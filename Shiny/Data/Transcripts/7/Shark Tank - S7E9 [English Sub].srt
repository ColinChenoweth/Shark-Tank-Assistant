AND PART OF
A SUPPORTIVE ORGANIZATION.

WE JUST LAUNCHED
OUR 40th AFFILIATE

00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,089

SO ESSENTIALLY,
THEY RUN LEAGUES FOR US,

00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,359

WE WORK WITH THEM

AS AN EXCLUSIVE
EQUIPMENT PROVIDER

AND LEAD GENERATION PARTNER,

00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,232
AND THEY'RE ACTIVELY
IN EACH CITY RUNNING LEAGUES.

00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:26,933
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
BEFORE YOU GET TECHNICAL,

00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,301
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T --
DID YOU PLAY?

00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,370
NO, I WATCHED YOU IDIOTS
BOUNCE OFF EACH OTHER.

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,006
-IT WAS FUN. IT WAS FUN.
-IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.

00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,374
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE
THAT MUCH FUN.

00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,076
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT.
IT REALLY IS.

00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,477
Cuban:
THE BUBBLES WERE FUN,

00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,146
BUT NO ONE CARED ABOUT
THE ACTUAL SOCCER, THE SPORT.

00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,313
YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT.

00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,782
SO THERE'S TWO TYPES
OF DEMOGRAPHICS

00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,783
THAT PLAY BUBBLE SOCCER.

00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,184
THERE'S
THE PRIVATE EVENT SIDE,

00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,086
WHICH IS BASICALLY PEOPLE
JUST WANT TO GET IN THE BUBBLES,

00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,922
TRY IT ONCE, CRASH INTO
EACH OTHER, HAVE SOME FUN.

00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,490
THEN THERE'S ALSO
THE LEAGUE SIDE.

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,793
THERE'S THE LEAGUE COMPETITOR.
THEY'RE ACTIVE.

00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,428
THEY'RE COMING BACK EVERY WEEK,
AND THEY'RE PLAYING IN GAMES.

00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,863
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE PLAYING IT TODAY?

00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,032
WE'RE ALIVE
IN ABOUT 39 CITIES.

00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,367
DEPENDING ON THE LEAGUE,

00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,702
IT'S ANYWHERE BETWEEN
8 TO 12 TEAMS.

00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,006
SO IF SOME OF IT IS EVENT
AND SOME OF IT IS THE LEAGUES,

00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,041
HOW MUCH OF IT IS
FOR PRIVATE EVENTS, PARTIES,

00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,176
THINGS LIKE THAT?

00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,644
IT'S ABOUT
A 50/50 SPLIT.

00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,879
BUT JOHN, FROM
A PROMOTIONAL PERSPECTIVE,

00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,215
WE'VE RENTED STUFF
THAT'S SIMILAR.

00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,651
WE DIDN'T INVENT THE SPORT
BY ANY MEANS.

00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,820
WE SAW -- THE WAY
THAT I ACTUALLY GOT INTO THIS

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,088
IS I HAD SEEN SOME VIRAL VIDEOS

00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,257
OVER IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
AND IN AUSTRALIA --

00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,126
ARE THESE LEAGUES
EXISTING THERE?
YEAH.

00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,028
HOW BIG HAS THIS GONE
IN EUROPE?

00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,496
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS ACTUALLY

00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,764
THOSE LEAGUES ARE THRIVING
MORE THAN EVER.

00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,265
DEFINE THRIVING.

00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,667
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE,

00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,069
I DON'T HAVE THE SEARCH VOLUME
FOR EUROPE OFF-HAND,

00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,405
BUT JUST THE UNITED STATES,
IN 2014,

00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:41,007
THE LARGEST NUMBER OF SEARCHES
PER MONTH IN GOOGLE

00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,076
WAS ABOUT 55,000 SEARCHES.

00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,413
IN 2015, IT GOT UP TO
85,000 SEARCHES.

00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:47,814
BUT JOHN --
BUT DON'T TELL ME THE SEARCHES.

00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,249
TELL ME THE SALES
IN EUROPE.

HOW MANY LEAGUES THERE.
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE SALES IN EUROPE,

THE PARTICULAR SEASON, SO --

00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,901
WHY CAN'T I GET
A STRAIGHT ANSWER FROM YOU?

00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,336

WHAT HAPPENS IN AUSTRALIA.

00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,404

HOW MUCH MONEY
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE EACH YEAR?

00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,081
SO WE'VE BEEN IN THE MARKET
FOR ABOUT 13 MONTHS.

THUS FAR, IN TOTAL SALES,
WE'VE DONE $355,867 IN SALES.

00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,187
AND WHERE'S THAT REVENUE
COMING FROM?

00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,656
YEAR ONE WAS EXCLUSIVELY
EQUIPMENT SALES,

00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,825

BUT KNOWING YOU'RE JUST

00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,825
JUST THROWING THEM OUT
IS --

00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,594

00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,338
AND YOU'RE DOING
DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW?
ABSOLUTELY.

00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:19,372
JOHN, WHERE DO YOU SEE IT GOING?
DO YOU MANUFACTURE THE BUBBLES?

00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,174
YES, WE MANUFACTURE
THE EQUIPMENT.

00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,943
TELL US WHAT THE BALLS COST,
JOHN.

00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,377
SO TOTAL-ENDED COST FOR US

00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,047
IS ANYWHERE BETWEEN
$150 TO $160 PER BALL.

00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,481
-WOW.
-WOW.

00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,116
-OH, REALLY? WOW.
-WHAT DO YOU SELL THEM FOR?

00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,585
TO THE END CUSTOMER, WE SELL
THEM IN FOUR DIFFERENT PACKAGES,

00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,355
RANGING ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT
$4,000 TO ABOUT $16,000.

00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,425
OH, SO THAT'S WHY YOU NEED
A LEAGUE, RIGHT?

00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,427
IT'S AN INVESTMENT
IN A BUSINESS.

00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,062
YOU'RE NOT SELLING THE BALLS
INDIVIDUALLY.

00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,229
-NO.
-YOU SELL THEM AS A PACKAGE.

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,365
THIS IS SOMEONE INVESTING IN
A BUSINESS.

00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,267
SO, JOHN,
I PAID YOU THE $4,000.

00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,470
HOW MUCH MORE MONEY DO YOU MAKE
FROM ME OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS?

00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,072
WE WORK WITH OUR AFFILIATES
IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.

00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,574
WE OFFER OPTIONAL
EQUIPMENT PROTECTION PLANS.

00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,411
YOU'RE PAYING ANYWHERE FROM
$90 A MONTH TO ABOUT $120

00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,413
'CAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE
A COST-PER-LEAD,

00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,048
SO IF WE SEND YOU FOUR LEADS,

00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,950
IT'S $8 PER LEAD
THAT WE SEND YOU.

00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,920
SO THE ONGOING REVENUE
IS FROM LEAD GENERATION.

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,656
IT'S FROM LEAD GENERATION
AND EXTENDED WARRANTY PROGRAM.

00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,257
I FIND THIS
VERY CONFUSING.

00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,027
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU HAVE
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON.

00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:17,664
YOU HAVE LEAGUES AND THEN
YOU HAVE EVENTS AND PARTIES.

00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,533
SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO
CATER TO THE MARKET

00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,902
IN HOWEVER THEY WANT
TO EXPERIENCE THIS SPORT.

00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,338
WHEN YOU DO IT
FOR THE PARTIES AND EVENTS,

00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,874
WHAT DO YOU CHARGE PEOPLE
TO USE THEM FOR THE DAY?

00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,109
A TYPICAL BIRTHDAY PARTY

00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,610
WILL BRING IN ANYWHERE BETWEEN
$300 TO $500.

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,612
SORRY, JOHN.
DO YOU DO THIS DIRECT

00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,781
OR DO THE LOCAL FRANCHISEES
DO THOSE?

00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,282
THE LOCAL FRANCHISEES --
SO THEY ARE --

00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,318
SO YOU DON'T MAKE MONEY
ON THE CORPORATE EVENTS?
NO.

00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,153
-I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.
-SEE, THAT'S THE KEY.

00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,955
THE BULK OF JOHN'S SALES
ARE ONE-TIME.

00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,156
JOHN,
I DID NOT REALIZE THAT.

00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,491
HE DOESN'T CARE
WHAT THEY USE THEM FOR --

00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:47,193
CORPORATE OR WHETHER
THEY'RE PLAYING A GAME.

00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,262
IT ALWAYS BOTHERS ME
WHEN AN ENTREPRENEUR

00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,164
COMES INTO THE SHARK TANK
AND IMMEDIATELY,

00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,433
THE SHARKS TRY TO REDEFINE
THEIR BUSINESS MODEL.

00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:56,202
THAT MEANS IT'S NOT CLEAR.

00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,538
IT DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH OF A DEFINITION

00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,142
IN TERMS OF PLACING CASH
BACK TO ME AS AN INVESTOR.

00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,743
AND YOU WERE ALL OVER THE MAP,
YOU KNOW?

00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,479
I STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU EVER MAKE ANY MONEY.

00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,049
YOU DID A REALLY POOR JOB
EXPLAINING IT TO ME.

00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,584
SORRY. I'M OUT.

00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,319
SURE.

00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,090
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THIS IS
GREAT FOR THE CONSUMER.

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,727
I DON'T SEE THE VISION
FOR THE LEAGUES, SO I'M OUT.

00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:25,165
JOHN, THE LONGER YOU TALKED,
THE MORE CONFUSING IT GOT.

00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,401
THE LONGER YOU TALKED, THE MORE
BUSINESS MODELS THERE WERE.

00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,403
IT FELL APART FOR ME.

00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,838
I'M OUT.

00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,208
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE TO HEAR,
BECAUSE ON THE TECH SIDE,

00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,143
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A HUGE
TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE

00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,446
THAT WE ACTIVELY
NEED SOME HELP MANAGING.

00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,647
SEE, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:41,781
NOW IT'S A TECH BUSINESS.

00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,017
PICK ONE BUSINESS
AND GROW THAT PART.

00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,152
WHY?
THEY ALL MAKE MONEY.

00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,955
John: YOU CAN'T DO EVERYTHING
TO EVERYBODY.

00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,357
I ACTUALLY HAVE TO
TAKE MY HAT OFF TO YOU

00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,761
BECAUSE YOU'VE SCALED
PRETTY QUICKLY IN 13 MONTHS.

00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,162
MY CHALLENGE IS

00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,665
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA SCALE
MUCH LARGER THAN IT IS NOW.

00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,266
YOU'VE DONE WELL WITH IT
TO THIS POINT,

00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,634
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HIT
A BRICK WALL.

00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,670
I'M OUT.

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,206
I DON'T SEE ANY BRICK WALLS,
BUT UNDERSTANDABLE.

00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,075
MARK, IF THERE'S ANYBODY WHO CAN
HELP WITH SPORTS AND TECH,

00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,410
I MEAN,
THAT'S OUR FOCUS HERE.

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,212
HERE'S WHAT I SEE.

00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,214
YOU'RE NOT IN
THE SOCCER BUSINESS.

00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,482
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
IN THE PRODUCTS.

00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,917
YOU'RE IN THE BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITY BUSINESS, RIGHT?

00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,186
WHAT'S KEY
IS YOUR AFFILIATES.

00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,988
IF YOU WOULD HAVE COME IN HERE
AND SAID, YOU KNOW,

00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,756
"WE HAVE AFFILIATES
IN 39 CITIES

00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,227
AND THEY ALL
MAKE $25,000 A YEAR,

00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,761
AND WE'RE GONNA
HELP THOSE AFFILIATES GROW

00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,698
TO MAKE
$100,000 A YEAR EACH,

00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,666
AND THAT'S GONNA BE
THE FOUNDATION

00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,235
OF GROWING THIS LEAGUE,"

00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,570
THAT WOULD HAVE TOLD US
WHAT BUSINESS YOU'RE IN,

00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,173
BUT YOU WERE SO CONVOLUTED
IN TRYING TO SHOW US THE NUMBERS

00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,142
AND HOW WELL
YOU UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS,

00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,944
YOU MISSED THE BASIC POINT
OF WHAT YOUR BUSINESS WAS.

00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,479
IT WAS HARD TO UNDERSTAND.

00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,614
I'M OUT.

00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,150
WOW.

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,951
THAT'S SURPRISING.

00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:52,819
-OKAY.
-NOT REALLY.

00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,420
-REALLY?
-NOT REALLY.

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,589
YOU GOT FIVE PEOPLE
THAT AREN'T CLEAR ABOUT IT.

00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,091
THANK YOU, GUYS, VERY MUCH.

00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,530
CAN'T SELL THEM ALL.

00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,865
VERY, VERY SMART SHARKS,
VERY SMART BUSINESSMEN,

00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,234
BUT THEY DID
MAKE A MISTAKE TODAY,

00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,035
AND WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.
IT'S FINE.

00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,378
Narrator: NEXT INTO THE TANK

00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,614
ARE ENTREPRENEURS HOPING TO MAKE
A TRADITIONAL BRAZILIAN STAPLE

00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,583
INTO A POPULAR AMERICAN SNACK.

00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,857
HI, SHARKS.
MY NAME IS JUNEA.

00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,158
AND I'M CAMERON.

00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,860
WE'RE THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM
FROM PORTLAND, OREGON,

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,094
BEHIND BRAZI BITES.

00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,864
WE'RE SEEKING
A $200,000 INVESTMENT

00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:41,067
IN EXCHANGE FOR 10% EQUITY
IN OUR AWESOME COMPANY.

00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:45,738
SHARKS, BRAZIL IS KNOWN FOR
ITS BEAUTY AND EXOTIC CULTURE,

00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,575
BUT IT ALSO HAS
AMAZING FOOD.

00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,410
I GREW UP IN BRAZIL,

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,913
AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE FOODS
IS BRAZILIAN CHEESE BREAD.

00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,584
IT IS CRISPY ON THE OUTSIDE
AND FLUFFY INSIDE.

00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,285
IT IS SO DELICIOUS,

00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:03,256
YOU WOULD NEVER GUESS THAT
IT'S NATURALLY GLUTEN-FREE.

00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,825
WHEN I MOVED TO THE U.S.,
I WAS SHOCKED.

00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,660
I COULDN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE.

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,196
THIS BREAD IS TOO GOOD
NOT TO SHARE,

00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,198
SO WE TOOK
JUNEA'S SECRET FAMILY RECIPE

00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,367
AND DEVELOPED A PRODUCT LINE
THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE

00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:17,136
THE BEST-TASTING, HIGHEST
QUALITY BRAZILIAN CHEESE BREAD

00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,638
AVAILABLE ANYWHERE.

00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,406
TODAY, WE HAVE
FOUR DELICIOUS FLAVORS

00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,308
THAT GO STRAIGHT FROM
THE FREEZER TO THE OVEN

00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,077
AND ARE READY TO ENJOY
IN MINUTES.

00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,312
OUR CUSTOMERS
CAN'T GET ENOUGH.

00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,214
-SO WHO IS READY TO JOIN US?
-BRING IT ON. LET'S GO.

00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,749
OUR MISSION TO BRING
SOUTH AMERICA FLAVORS.

00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,917
-GO. WE'RE HUNGRY.
-LET'S TRY IT.
-I'M DYING TO TRY.

00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,652
YOU GUYS READY FOR SOME SAMPLES?
ALL RIGHT.

00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,420
THANK YOU.

00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,623
-THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
-DIFFERENT FLAVORS?

00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,658
Cameron: DIFFERENT FLAVORS.
THERE'S FOUR FLAVORS THERE.

00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,360
THEY'RE MARKED WITH TOOTHPICKS
FOR THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS.

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,762
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS SO GOOD.

00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,764
THE BACON?
RIGHT?

00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,734
MMM, GARLIC ASIAGO.

00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:51,571
Junea: SO, THE FLOUR THAT MAKES
THE BREAD IS TAPIOCA FLOUR,

00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,474
AND IT'S NATURALLY GLUTEN-FREE.

00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,376
OH, MY GOD,
THE PEPPER JACK IS SO GOOD.

00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,311
-OHH!
-THESE ARE REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,746
-AMAZING.
-THANK YOU.

00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,481
HOW MANY CALORIES?

00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:05,752
SO, THE SERVING SIZE IS THREE
PIECES, AND IT HAS 120 CALORIES.

00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,488
IT ONLY HAS
EIGHT INGREDIENTS.

00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,957
MMM-MMM-MMM.
NO PRESERVATIVES,
NOTHING ARTIFICIAL.

00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,558
CAN YOU COOK THEM
IN A MICROWAVE?

00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,693
-NO.
-NO.

00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,095
-WHAT?
-BECAUSE WE SELL
AS FROZEN DOUGH,

00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,064
YOU GOT TO BAKE IT,
BUT IT'S REALLY EASY.

00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,832
IT'S STRAIGHT FROM THE FREEZER
TO THE OVEN.

00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,701
IF YOU CAN BAKE FROZEN PIZZA
AT HOME,

00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,070
YOU CAN MAKE BRAZI BITES.
IT'S THAT EASY.

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,872
HOW MANY STORES ARE YOU IN?

00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:29,409
WE ARE NOW AVAILABLE
IN ABOUT 700 GROCERY STORES

00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,777
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,313
WE ARE, FOR EXAMPLE,
IN WHOLE FOODS MARKET.

00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,148
WE ARE IN
SPROUTS FARMERS MARKET.

00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,749
AND HOW DID YOU
GET TO THOSE PEOPLE?

00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,184
DO YOU HAVE SALES REPS?

00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,486
CAMERON AND I
KNOCKED ON DOORS AND --

00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,821
JUST POUNDING THE PAVEMENT
LOCALLY.
YOURSELF.

00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,855
WHEN DID YOU
START THE BUSINESS?

00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,691
Cameron: THREE YEARS AGO.

00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,093
SINCE THEN, WE'VE TRIPLED OUR
REVENUE EVERY YEAR, BASICALLY,

00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,395
SO IN 2013,
WE DID $60,000.

00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,564
WE DID $200,000
THE YEAR AFTER THAT.

00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,199
LAST YEAR, WE DID $600,000,

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,902
AND THIS YEAR, WE'RE ACTUALLY
ON TRACK TO DO OVER $1 MILLION.

00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:58,304
WOW.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,672
John: I'M TRYING TO SEE
WHERE I ADD VALUE.

00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,140
YOU'RE ALREADY DOING AMAZING,

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,410
AND YOU WILL CONTINUE TO GROW
IN THE WHOLE FOODS OF THE WORLD.

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,612
BUT I BELIEVE THAT ONLINE,
YOU CAN GET FULL MARGIN.

00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,281
-BUT I UNDERSTAND --
-SHIP IT FROZEN?

00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,549
-YES, SHIP IT.
-HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,184
LET ME TALK FIRST.

00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,120
BAD IDEA.

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,023
HERE'S WHERE
I BELIEVE I CAN HELP.

00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,092
AL "BUBBA" BAKER.
I JUST DID A DEAL WITH HIM --

00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,394
BUBBA'S BONELESS RIBS.

00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,730
WE GOT TO REALLY MESS UP
TO NOT DO $200 MILLION.

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,566
HE'S DOING $25,000 A MINUTE
ON QVC.

00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,969
HE'S WITH A GROUP CALLED
RASTELLI FRESH FOOD MARKET,

00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,638
AND THEY SHIP GOODS,
LIKE OMAHA STEAKS.
MM-HMM.

00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,041
THIS COMPLEMENTS
THE STEAK AND THE SEAFOOD

00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,876
THAT ALL HAS TO BE SHIPPED
VERY TIME SENSITIVE,

00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,479
FROZEN, NEXT DAY,

00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,215
AND THEY ALREADY HAVE
A WIDE CUSTOMER BASE.

00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,250
AND THERE,
YOU GET MORE MONEY

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,319
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING
DIRECTLY TO THE CUSTOMER.

00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,687
-SURE.
-MM-HMM.

00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,356
BUT WHAT'S IT WORTH MY TIME?

00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:56,829
I WOULD HAVE TO ASK FOR...
25% FOR $200,000.

00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,166
IS THAT AN OFFER?

00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,801
MATTER OF FACT,
THAT IS AN OFFER.

00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:07,039
THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER, WE'D
LIKE TO HEAR IF THERE ARE ANY --

00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,144
I WOULD DO THE DEAL
200K FOR 20%.

00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,282
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,450
Greiner: I'M SITTING HERE
THINKING ABOUT IT,

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,786
BECAUSE I DID A DEAL
LAST YEAR

00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,188
WITH THE BANTAM BAGELS
STUFFED BAGEL BALLS, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,190
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS,
IT LOOKS VERY SIMILAR.

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,360
I'M WONDERING
HOW THIS COULD INTEGRATE

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,264
WITH MY STUFFED BAGEL BALLS
OR IF IT'S COMPETITIVE.

00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,199
STOP AND THINK
FOR A MINUTE,

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,134
AND TELL ME
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE

00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:40,173
BETWEEN MY BANTAM BAGELS
STUFFED BAGEL BALLS AND YOU.

00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,444
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT
OUR PRODUCT IS GLUTEN-FREE.

00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,046
YOU GOT IT.
THEIR'S IS A TRADITIONAL BAGEL
MADE WITH WHEAT.

00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,247
-GOOD ANSWER.
-YES.

00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,450
-RIGHT ANSWER.
-I WAS NERVOUS FOR YOU.

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:56,656
I'M GONNA OFFER $200,000 FOR
THE SAME 25% DAYMOND SAID.

00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,357
OOH.

00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,726
NICE STORY.
TOUGH OFFER.

00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,428
TOUGH OFFER.

00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,863
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:07,366
I'LL DROP MY ASK TO
15% FOR THE 200K,

00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,367
JUST TO
MAKE IT INTERESTING.

00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,802
YOU'VE GOT KEVIN
GOING THE RIGHT WAY.

00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,371
AND TO PUT SOME PRESSURE
ON THESE OTHER SHARKS.

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,245
GUYS, YOU'VE GOT A FEEDING
FRENZY FOR YOUR BRAZILIAN BITES.

00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,325
Narrator:
ALL SHARKS ARE STILL IN,

00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,194
BUT JUNEA AND CAMERON
HAVE THREE OFFERS ON THE TABLE

00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,498
FOR THEIR BRAZILIAN
CHEESE BREAD, BRAZI BITES.

00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:43,035
GUYS, YOU'VE GOT A FEEDING
FRENZY FOR YOUR BRAZILIAN BITES.

00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,706
KEVIN, CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
YOUR VISION FOR THE COMPANY?

00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,407
YOU KNOW,
THE WAY I LOOK AT THIS IS

00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:52,245
IT'S ONE-AT-A-TIME SALE
INTO PLACES LIKE

00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:55,815
EVERY RETAILER THAT CARRIES
ANYTHING IN THE FROZEN CATEGORY.

00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:59,352
Greiner: TO ME, I SEE YOUR REAL
HOOK RIGHT NOW, YOUR FIRST STEP

00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,355
IS TO DOMINATE ALL OF THE
NATURAL AND ORGANIC FOOD PLACES

00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,724
FIRST SO THAT YOU CAN
GET REALLY STRONG

00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,325
AND MAKE YOUR BRAND KNOWN.

00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,895
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE FOUND IN
THE OTHER GROCERY CHAINS,

00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,096
IT'LL BE RECOGNIZED.

00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,531
John:
DO YOU HAVE DEBT ON THE COMPANY?

00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,032
WE ACTUALLY HAD TO TAKE ON DEBT

00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,600
IN ORDER TO BUILD OUT
OUR PRODUCTION FACILITY.

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,302
AND HOW MUCH DEBT
DO YOU HAVE NOW?

00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,804
SO OUR DEBT ON THE BOOKS
IS ABOUT $200,000,

00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,706
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY
IN THE PROCESS

00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,808
OF TRANSITIONING
OUT OF PRODUCTION.

00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,744
AND WHEN WE DO THAT, WE'RE GONNA
SELL A LOT OF OUR EQUIPMENT,

00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:25,811
SO WE'RE GONNA RECOUP
A LOT OF THAT.

00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,613
WHY ARE YOU TRANSITIONING
OUT OF THAT?

00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,549
DO YOU FIND A GREAT CO-PACK
OR A PARTNER?

00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,284
YEAH, WE ACTUALLY HAVE
A CO-PACKING PARTNER

00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,652
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE
WORKING WITH, AND --

00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,520
AND IS THAT PERSON GONNA OWN
ANY OF THE COMPANY, AS WELL?

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,688
THEY'VE MADE AN INVESTMENT
IN THE COMPANY.

00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,323
HOW MUCH IS THAT?

00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,592
WE HAVE A 50-50 PARTNERSHIP
WITH THEM.

00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:40,760
-WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
-SO YOU --

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,029
Cuban: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,931
YEAH, YOU GUYS OWN
50% OF THE COMPANY.

00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,832
-CORRECT.
-YES.

00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,502
Cameron: THEY MADE A MULTI-TIER
INVESTMENT THAT INVOLVED CASH,

00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,505
A LINE OF CREDIT, AND THEY'RE
BUILDING OUT A FACILITY.

00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,040
THEY'RE ORDERING
CUSTOM EQUIPMENT FROM BRAZIL.

00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,377
Herjavec: HERE'S WHERE IT
KIND OF FALLS APART FOR ME.

00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,813
I WISH YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
SOLD 50% OF IT.

00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,982
-I DON'T KNOW THE OTHER PARTNER.
-MM-HMM.

00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:04,750
THEY'RE NOT HERE
REPRESENTING ANYTHING.

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,186
AT THIS POINT IN THE GROWTH,
IT'S JUST NOT FOR ME.

00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,255
I'M OUT.

00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,456
-OKAY.
-THANK YOU, ROBERT.

00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,490
THANK YOU, ROBERT.
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,594
GUYS, LET'S JUST SAY
YOU MADE $25 MILLION.

00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,696
BA-BAM, RIGHT?

00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:20,733
FOR OUR 10%,
ONLY $2.5 COMES TO ME.

00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,502
MM-HMM.
THE RISK-REWARD
HAS GOT TO BE GREATER.

00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,706
NOW, THAT MIGHT SOUND CRAZY --
$200,000 TO $2.5 MILLION.

00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:27,974
THAT SEEMS ENORMOUS.

00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:31,611
BUT IT'S ALL RELATIVE
TO THE AMOUNT OF WORK INVOLVED.

00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,779
SO EVEN IN
YOUR OPTIMAL SCENARIO,

00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,748
IT'S NOT ENOUGH,
SO FOR THOSE REASONS, I'M OUT.

00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,753
-THANK YOU, MARK.
-FAIR ENOUGH.

00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,655
JUST TO ADDRESS YOUR OFFERS,

00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:46,192
WE'D SAY THAT WE'D KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU GUYS BRING TO THE TABLE,

00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:50,196
BUT 25% IS JUST
MORE THAN WE'RE CAPABLE OF --

00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,530
Herjavec:
CAMERON, MAKE A COUNTER.

00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,399
Greiner: SEE, THAT'S WHAT'S
INTERESTING THAT HAPPENS

00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:54,767
WHEN YOU COME INTO
THE SHARK TANK

00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,970
AND YOU'VE GIVEN AWAY 50%
OF YOUR COMPANY TO SOMEONE ELSE.

00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,305
-IT'S A PROBLEM.
-RIGHT?

00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,241
IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT
FOR YOU TO NEGOTIATE.

00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:08,247
LORI, WOULD YOU MATCH
KEVIN'S OFFER FOR 15%?

00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,283
WOW, YOU'RE NOT A SHARK.
YOU'RE CHOPPED TUNA.

00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,452
O'Leary: JUST TO
MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING,

00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,154
I'LL DROP MINE TO 12.5%.

00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,357
SO, KEVIN, IN THAT CASE,

00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,426
WOULD YOU JUST GO TO OUR 10%
AND GIVE US --

00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,327
-YEAH, RIGHT.
-I'LL DO IT FOR 12.5%.

00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,428
THANK YOU.
THAT'S WHAT HE DESERVED.

00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,896
-I'LL DO IT RIGHT NOW AT 12.5%.
-OKAY.

00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,531
John: BUT GUYS, THEY'RE NOT
BEING CREATIVE AT ALL.

00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,866
THEY'RE NOT GROWING THE COMPANY
WITH THE STRATEGY.

00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,068
WOULD YOU RATHER GO 12%
WITH KEVIN?

00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,469
LORI, WHERE WOULD YOU GO?
GUYS, THEY'RE NOT GROWING
THE COMPANY WITH THE STRATEGY.

00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,805
-LORI.
-I WOULD GO TO 20%.

00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,473
-THAT'S BRUTAL.
-AND I DON'T --

00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,475
THE PROBLEM IS IS I DON'T
WANT TO SQUEEZE YOU HERE.
YEAH.

00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,077
I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL BAD
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,379
YOU GAVE AWAY
50% OF YOUR COMPANY,

00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,815
WHICH MIGHT BE A GOOD MOVE
TO A CO-PACKER.
IT WAS A GREAT DECISION, YEAH.

00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,918
JUNEA, YOU'VE GOT TO
MAKE SOME DECISION.

00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,854
IS THAT YOUR FINAL OFFER?

00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,091
IT'S MY FINAL OFFER.
THAT'S AS LOW AS I'LL GO.

00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,559
OTHERWISE,
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.

00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,994
-DAYMOND?
-I'LL GO TO 20%.

00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:55,895
-I'LL MATCH LORI.
-ALL RIGHT.

00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,698
SO TWO OFFERS FOR 20%,
ONE AT 12.5%.

00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,866
I'LL GO TO 18%.

00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,003
WOW.

00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,705
HEY,
YOU GOT SHARKS ON DISCOUNT.

00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,740
UM...

00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,113
LORI WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO
DO THE DEAL FOR 15%?

00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,151
OOH.
25% TO 15%.

00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,653
I'M WORRIED.

00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,321
DON'T BE.

00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,823
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,692
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT. YOU HAVE
GREAT ENTREPRENEURS HERE.

00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,760
THIS IS
A SUCCESSFUL BRAND.

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,528
YOU ARE A SUCCESSFUL BRAND
ALREADY,

00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,364
BUT YOU HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES
TO GO THROUGH, TOO.

00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,899
-ABSOLUTELY.
-AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED --

00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,502
A SHARK.

00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:39,205
IT'S GONNA BE BIG.

00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:43,409
18% I WAS AT,
AND YOU WANT ME TO GO TO 15%.

00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,643
YES.

00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,248
I'LL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE.

00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,084
$200,000 FOR 16.5%.

00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,620
O'Leary: LET ME MAKE IT
MORE INTERESTING FOR YOU.

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,688
I'M OUT.

00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,323
YEAH. I'M OUT.

00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,663
LORI, YOU GOT A DEAL.

00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,599
[ GASPS ]

00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,234
THEY ARE DELICIOUS.

00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:11,003
THAT REALLY PUSHED ME
OVER THE EDGE

00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,572
BECAUSE FOR GLUTEN-FREE

WITH CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,568
OKAY.
THERE'S AT LEAST
FIVE, SIX BRANDS

00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,770
-I CAN THINK OF RIGHT NOW...
-REALLY?

00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,706
...WHERE -- YES, THERE ARE.
I KNOW.

00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,741
-YOU KNOW WHAT?
-I KNOW BECAUSE I HELPED THEM

00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:50,942
WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF THEIR MARKETING.

00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,410
WE HAVE NEVER SAID

00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,279
THAT THERE WAS NO COMPETITORS
OUT THERE, LORI.

00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,780
THE DIFFERENCE
WITH OUR PRODUCT

00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,782
THAT YOU GUYS
REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND --

00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,018
THIS HAS A DUAL PURPOSE.

00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,187
THE DUAL PURPOSE IS THAT IT
CAN A FASHION ACCESSORY, OKAY?

00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:04,322
-FASHION.
-A FASHION ACCESSORY?

00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,024
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE
A CUFF LINK FOR YOUR SOCKS.

00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,492
-CUSTOMIZABLE.
-SO THINK ABOUT IT.

00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,494
-TEAM COLORS.
-WE CAN PUT TEAMS ON HERE.

00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:10,895
-TEAM LOGO.
-TRACIE, YOU ARE A HUSTLER.

00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,230
-I AM.
-YOU ARE 100%.

00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,832
I'M FROM THE SOUTH SIDE,
AND I BELIEVE IN MY PRODUCT.

00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,867
MY PROBLEM HERE IS

00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:20,438
I KNOW PEOPLE THAT MAKE VERY
COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS TO THIS.

00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:23,775
I THINK IT WOULD BE A CONFLICT
FOR THIS BUSINESS RIGHT NOW.

00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,076
I HAVE TO BE OUT.

00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,279
Herjavec:
TRACIE, YOU KNOW,

00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,582
I THINK PEOPLE HAVE BOUGHT
A LOT OF THIS PRODUCT

00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:34,786
BECAUSE OF THE POWER
AND UNIVERSE OF TRACIE.

00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,822
I BELIEVE THAT.
I THINK
YOU COULD SELL ANY PRODUCT.

00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,825
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE GIVING ME
A LOT OF CREDIT.

00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,228
TRACIE, LOOK, I'M GONNA LET YOU
FOCUS ON THE RIGHT SHARK.

00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:45,663
I'M NOT THE RIGHT SHARK
FOR THIS DEAL.

00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,499
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM
IN LOSING SOCKS.

00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:48,600
I DON'T SEE ME
PUTTING THIS IN MY SOCKS.

00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,136
AMERICA DOES.
ANYONE THAT HAS FEET.

00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:52,370
AND THERE'S A COMPETITIVE
PRODUCT. I'M OUT.

00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,605
THAT'S 'CAUSE ALL OF HIS SOCKS
ARE DIFFERENT COLORS

00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,106
AND DIFFERENT STYLES
AND DIFFERENT PATTERNS.

00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,075
-LET'S TAKE STOCK.
-I'M OUT!

00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:00,979
SO, GUYS,
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,480
WHAT'S YOUR BACKGROUND?

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,316
WELL, I'M A PRODUCT OF
THE INNER CITY OF CHICAGO.

00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:08,686
I'M THE VERY FIRST PERSON OUT OF
ABOUT 27 OF MY FIRST COUSINS

00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,256
TO ACTUALLY GRADUATE
FROM COLLEGE.

00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:13,491
I'M NOW
A PHARMACEUTICAL SALES REP.

00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,861
I'VE WON THE PRESIDENTIAL AWARD
RESERVED FOR ONLY THE TOP 7%.

00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,062
YEAH!

00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,198
WHAT ABOUT YOU, GLEN?

00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,200
SAME THING --
RAISED ON THE SOUTH SIDE,

00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,170
MY MOTHER WORKED TWO JOBS TO PUT
MY SISTER AND I THROUGH SCHOOL.

00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,906
WENT TO NORTHWESTERN, UNIVERSITY
OF ILLINOIS MEDICAL SCHOOL,

00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:29,808
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO
FOR RESIDENCY,

00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,442
AND NOW I'VE BEEN IN
PRACTICE 19 YEARS.

00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,577
WOW.

00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,312
John:
HERE'S WHERE I'M AT.

00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,581
IT'S VERY HARD
FOR ME TO DO THIS DEAL

00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,117
BECAUSE IF MY BOMBAS SOCKS GUYS
FOUND I WOULD DO THIS,

00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,019
THEY WOULD BEAT ME SO HARD

00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,420
THAT I'D BE
HOOKED ON PAINKILLERS

00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,421
-FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
-CAN I STOP YOU RIGHT THERE?

00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,590
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WE WANT TO PURSUE

00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:51,095
IS TO GET A LICENSING DEAL WITH
A SHOE OR A SOCK MANUFACTURER.

00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,398
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE --
YOU HAVE A SOCK --

00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,732
YES,
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:58,136
LOSING SOCKS IS WHERE WE MAKE,
YOU KNOW, OUR BUSINESS.

00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:59,304
Tracie:
WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO IS

00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:00,905
MAINTAIN THE SOCKS
THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE.

00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,941
YOU KNOW HOW MANY MOMS
ARE AFRAID TO SPEND $20

00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:04,642
ON THEIR 12-YEAR-OLD?

00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:05,810
NOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,145
GUYS, I GOT IT.
LISTEN. I GOT --

00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:08,746
YOU KNOW
THOSE FASHIONABLE SOCKS

00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:09,747
THAT THEY'RE WEARING WITH
THE FLIP-FLOPS?
SOCCER SOCKS!

00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,450
GUYS, I'M SORRY.
I LOVE YOU, BUT I'M OUT.

00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,286
NO, DAYMOND.
OKAY.

00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,889
ALL IS NOT LOST, TRACIE.
MARK'S STILL IN.

00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,058
-SO IS KEVIN.
-I AM, THAT'S TRUE.

00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,226
I WISH YOU HADN'T
BROUGHT THAT UP.

00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:22,727
CAN YOU IMAGINE
A MICKEY MOUSE?

00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,863
OKAY, YOU GUYS
ARE KIND OF THINKING

00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,030
THAT
I'M A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE.

00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,365
NO.

00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,034
THREE YEARS AGO,
I HAD A BRAIN ANEURYSM.

00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,940
I WAS AIRLIFTED
FROM ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS,

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,110
TO NORTHWESTERN HOSPITAL
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,780
FOLLOWED BY
AN 11-HOUR BRAIN SURGERY.

00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,685
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT GOD BROUGHT ME BACK

00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:51,256
STRONGER AND MORE FEISTY
THAN EVER.

00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,894
MARK. KEVIN.
ARE YOU IN? ARE YOU OUT?

00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,573
Narrator: THREE SHARKS ARE OUT.

00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,242
TRACIE AND GLEN ONLY HAVE
TWO MORE CHANCES

00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,112
TO GET A DEAL FOR THEIR COMPANY,
SOCKTABS.

00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:16,047
MARK. KEVIN.
ARE YOU IN? ARE YOU OUT?

00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,318
GUYS, LOOK. I DON'T WANT TO
BE IN THE SOCKTAB BUSINESS.

00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:21,920
THAT'S JUST THE HONEST-TO-GOD
TRUTH, RIGHT?

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,188
YEAH.
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN
MATCH YOUR PASSION ON THIS.

00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,324
AND THAT'S ALWAYS A PROBLEM,
RIGHT?

00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,393
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO BE THE ENTREPRENEUR.

00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,094
LET ME DO THAT.
I JUST NEED AN INVESTMENT.

00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,863
-WELL, LOOK.
-I NEED THE INVESTMENT.

00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,531
GOING OUT
AND GETTING $50,000,

00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,266
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S YOUR STUMBLING BLOCK.

00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,468
I THINK YOU WANT
SOMEBODY WHO CAN MATCH

00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,537
YOUR DESIRE
TO BE SUCCESSFUL

00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,472
THAT CAN BE THERE
WHEN YOU NEED THEM, RIGHT?

00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,374
YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE
A FORCE OF NATURE.

00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,576
I DON'T THINK
I CAN BE THERE FOR YOU.

00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:46,611
I'M OUT.

00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,949
Greiner: SO ONE SHARK LEFT.

00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,651
O'Leary:
TRACIE, WHAT I DON'T LIKE --

00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,486
YOU'RE NOT FULL-TIME
ON THIS DEAL.

00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:59,490
YOU'RE DOING IT AROUND YOUR JOB,
WHICH IS VERY LUCRATIVE, ONE,

00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,059
IF YOU'RE A SUCCESSFUL
PHARMA REP.

00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:04,195
YOUR HUSBAND IS A DOCTOR.
HE'S BUSY.

00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,364
WHO'S TAKING CARE OF
THE SOCKTABS?

00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:09,000
THERE'S NO FULL-TIME PERSON.
IT'S AN IDEA, IT'S A PRODUCT.

00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,668
-IT'S NOT A COMPANY.
-YOU KNOW WHAT, KEVIN?

00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:11,769
SO THAT'S AN ISSUE.

00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,472
I WILL DO
WHATEVER I NEED TO DO.

00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,974
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED
TO MY LIFE

00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,475
HAS PREPARED ME
FOR THIS MOMENT,

00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,379
AND I'M NOT GONNA WORK
PART-TIME FOR MY DREAM.

00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:22,714
NO, BUT LOOK --
I CAN ASSURE YOU
OF THAT RIGHT NOW.

00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,049
I DON'T THINK BUSINESS
CAN EVER REPLACE THE INCOME

00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,751
THAT YOU'RE MAKING
AS A PHARMA REP,

00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,152
'CAUSE
I THINK I KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,988
-THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.
-IT'S A GOOD NUMBER.

00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,923
AND I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
DO THAT TO YOUR FAMILY.

00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:34,392
AND I WOULD NOT
PUT THAT IN JEOPARDY.

00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,426
I'M SORRY.

00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,594
I'M OUT.

00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:39,831
THANK YOU, GUYS.

00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,032
-ALL RIGHT.
-I APPRECIATE IT.

00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,333
-THANK YOU, GUYS.
-THANK YOU.

00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,835
-GOOD LUCK, GUYS.
-BYE.
-THANK YOU.

00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,039
TRACIE.

00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:52,076
I'LL GIVE YOU $50,000 FOR 30%,
IF MY BOMBAS GUYS AGREE.

00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,077
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,714
COME ON.
OF COURSE.

00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,982
-WELL, LOOK AT THAT.
-ALL RIGHT.

00:41:57,982 --> 00:41:59,751
-AWW.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,155
-I APPRECIATE IT.
-AND DIDN'T WANT TO WALK OUT.

I REALLY DO.
I FEEL YOU.

-THANKS, MAN.

-THANK YOU.
-APPRECIATE IT.

00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,430
WE JUST NEEDED SOMEBODY
TO SEE OUR VISION,

00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,432
AND FORTUNATELY, AT THE LAST
MOMENT, DAYMOND SAW IT.

00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:15,933
AND THAT'S
WHAT WE WANTED ANYWAY.

00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,001
WE REALLY WANTED DAYMOND.

ALL THAT HARD WORK.
