00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,643
This year we're gonna do
$9 million.

00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,645
So we're already
cash‐flow positive.

00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,647
We just turned a profit
of $220,000.

00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,582
Herjavec:
I've heard enough.

00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,752
You're asking for $500,000
for 4%.

00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,754
I think you're here
to negotiate.

00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,824
I'll give you the $500,000
for 8%.

00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,561
Robert, thank you so much
for your offer.

00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,697
We believe it's way
below market.

00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,533
This is part of our Series "A"
round ‐‐ have a lead‐in ‐‐

00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,402
What was the Series "A" round
struck at?

00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,569
$2 million.

00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,405
We already have a lead
institutional investor.

00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,606
So then why are you here?

00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,508
Thee is a wise man

00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,311
with great business acumen
that once said...

00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,312
Yes, I'm here.

00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,479
..."There are many V. C. s,

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,814
but there's only one
Shark Tank."

00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,583
Well, that's why I made you
the offer at 8%.

00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,552
You're making my case.

00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,554
‐Very good.
‐Let me raise the ante.

00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,822
Are you saying you're not
valuing the Sharks?

00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,424
Let me raise the ante.
I don't ‐‐

00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,558
I don't disagree
with Robert.

00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:39,893
The value of a Shark
is huge,

00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,529
but there are Sharks
and then there's Mr. Wonderful.

00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,663
Who's really not a Shark.

00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,332
Because this falls
right into my...

00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,032
Who's a guppy.

00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,502
... right into my wine and food
business in a huge way.

00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,937
I already have all
your customers.

00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,440
I've got hundreds
of thousands of people

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,574
who buy direct from me.

00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,344
They will trust me,
as they do in the wine business.

00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,545
Nobody sells wine like I do.

00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,381
So I will give you
the same offer ‐‐

00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,749
$500,000 for 8%.

00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,551
I like this deal a lot.

00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,753
I can move a lot of units ‐‐
a lot.

00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:10,690
What are your biggest
challenges?

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,891
Philip:
This is a challenge, Mark.

00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,693
The great thing
about our company

00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,928
is we're creating
a category.

00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,764
The challenge with our company
is we're creating a category.

00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,499
‐Right.
‐Mark, do you have an offer?

00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,800
Cuban: I'm trying to find out,
you know,

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,002
if it seems too good to be true.

00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,970
Corcoran: It's always too good
to be true.

00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,573
I'm wildly enthusiastic
about the product,

00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,708
but I'm not wildly enthusiastic
about you.

00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,379
I feel like you're <i>too</i> slick.

00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,347
You have <i>every</i> answer.

00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,826
Narrator: All six Sharks
are still in.

00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,629
David and Philip have two offers
on the table

00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,698
for their draft‐beer
system Fizzics,

00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,501
but Barbara is skeptical
about the entrepreneurs.

00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,669
I'm wildly enthusiastic
about the product,

00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,838
but I'm not wildly enthusiastic
about you.

00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,474
I feel like you're <i>too</i> slick.

00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,709
You have <i>every</i> answer.

00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,646
And my gut is ringing,

00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,648
"There's got to be
something wrong."

00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,284
You're too slick for me.
I don't trust you.

00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,620
So I'm out.

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,824
Phil, the main reason that
I started to do this show

00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,860
and love this program is all the
people that really need help.

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,830
You don't need any money.
You're cash flow positive.

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,932
Why are you here?
‐We need to scale.

00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,967
There are some retailers
that we want to go into

00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,637
that we currently can't 'cause
we have channel conflict.

00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,605
So, what I want to show ‐‐
‐Give me an example of that.

00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,074
‐What I want to show you all...
‐Give me an example.

00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,809
...is what we're anticipating
and what we're investing in.

00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,644
You didn't even get
to your slides yet?

00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:38,878
[ Laughter ]

00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,513
Philip: This is our
next‐generation product.

00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,815
Phil, Phil, I'm just gonna
let everybody ‐‐

00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,149
Wait, wait, wait,
I want to see.

00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,318
‐Phil, Phil, Phil, Phil,
Phil, Phil, Phil!
‐This is our next‐generation ‐‐

00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,586
‐Yes, sir?
‐I'm out.

00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,720
‐Okay.
‐Why'd you do that?

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,822
‐Okay.
‐Just let him go, Phil.

00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,523
‐Go, Phil.
‐I'm not out.

00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,758
‐Wait, Phil. Phil.
‐I'm still in, Phil.

00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,926
He's out.
You got five more to go.

00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,661
‐I'm interested.
‐We worked really hard
to be here.

00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:55,962
Can you please show me
what that is?

00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,764
And we have a lot to share. And
that's what we're trying to do.

00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,499
So, this is Waytop.
We're gonna launch this.

00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,734
This is a more cost‐effective
price point.

00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,936
It's much smaller.

00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,671
‐How is that different, though?
‐What's the difference?

00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,875
This one would only do a can
and up to a 12‐ounce bottle.

00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,778
Phil, the great thing for you
is I have QVC

00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,682
and TV sales because you need to
get out there ‐‐ education.

00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,916
You need people
to know what it is.

00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,651
‐Absolutely.
‐So it's free advertising.

00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:23,957
So I am also going to give you
$500,000 for 8%.

00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,393
Ooh, everybody seems stuck
at that 8%.

00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,561
Everybody's at 8%.

00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,796
Phil, just so you know,
this is a fact ‐‐

00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,064
the number‐one provider of wine
on QVC is me.

00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:34,701
Where do you want to go that you
can't get to right now?

00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,704
Yeah, we want to be in Bed Bath
&amp; Beyond with that product.

00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,706
Whoa! That's where I have
a huge relationship.

00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,574
I think at $99 at Bed Bath
&amp; Beyond, they have ‐‐

00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,842
Cuban: Okay,
that makes more sense.

00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,278
You know I have
a great relationship
with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.

00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:45,912
Hello, Phil?

00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,680
What about in commercial ‐‐
in restaurants and bars?

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,449
‐Phil, Phil, Phil?
‐Tabletop type thing.

00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,884
‐Phil?
‐What are you doing there?

00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,752
So, we've had
some discussions.

00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,954
Can it withstand
commercial abuse, right?

00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,523
‐Yes.
‐Phil, you have three offers.

00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:57,557
What are you gonna do,
Mark?

00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,192
Okay, so, I'm gonna make
an offer.

00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,530
And I'll even open up to Lori
to come in on my offer.

00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,000
So I'll offer you $800,000
for 10%.

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,971
That valuation is higher
than the $500,000 for 8%,

00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,774
but it gives you more cash
so you can go to work faster,

00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,709
and you have
either one or two Sharks.

00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,546
I would like to make a counter
to Mark and Lori.

00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,647
I like the deal.

00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,415
All right, I think we would be
great partners.

00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,616
This is our
Series "A" round.

00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,485
If you wanted to take
the whole Series "A,"

00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,586
we're looking
to raise $2 million

00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,754
at a $10 million
pre‐money valuation.

00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,423
Yeah, right.
So that's 16%?

00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,858
Yes. 16.67%.

00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,561
‐Well, I want to compete ‐‐
‐Okay, I'll do that deal.

00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,728
‐Done.
‐Oh, my God!

00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,730
‐Deal!
‐[ Laughs ]

‐Put it up here.
‐Get up here.

‐I'm not a beer drinker.
‐You are now, baby!

We did it!

left great jobs.

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,611
This is the American dream.

00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,513

right now.

Narrator: In Season 7,
Shaan Patel secured a deal

00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:11,497
with Mark Cuban for his SAT
prep course 2400 Expert.

00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,534
I'll offer you the 250k
for 20%.

00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,169
All right,
I take your offer, Mark.

00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:16,803
Done.

00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,605
Narrator: Let's see
what he's up to now.

00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,506
Patel: Since making my deal
with Mark,

00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,609
we changed the name
from 2400 Expert

00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,712
to Prep Expert because the SAT
went from the 2400 scale

00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,447
back to the 1600 scale.

00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:28,615
Welcome, everyone.

00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,617
Today I'm teaching
a special program

00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,486
to underserved youth in
my community of Las Vegas.

00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,787
So, who's ready to do a problem?

00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,790
They are high‐achieving
but simply lack the resources

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,959
to get great standardized
test scores.

00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,463
Give a big round of applause
for Mark Cuban!

Shaan has invited me out

00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:46,866
to this program that he's doing
with his community,

00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,534
and I thought it would be great
to come out here

00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,869
and get the kids fired up
and have a good time.

00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,438
It really doesn't matter
where you start.

00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,539
Anything is possible.

00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,807
When I come out and talk
to these kids,

00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,976
I see in their eyes they want to
accomplish things in their life.

00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,479
And if I can just give them
a little bit of motivation,

00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,747
that's a huge win.

00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:03,383
The key is finding something
you really like to do

00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,484
and then being great at it.

Thank you, everybody.

00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,067
My goal as a Shark
is to go out there

00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,870
and help as many kids as I can
to accomplish their dreams

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,605

over the years,

is that the customer acquisition
cost is the whole deal.

‐Right.
‐Whole deal.

That's why I'm attracted
to this.

‐No, I get it.

But, you know,
you've once said

the damage before it was done.

00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,774
In this era of
digital parenting,

00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,744
ReThink also provides parents
an opportunity

00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,980
to help shape
their child's behavior

00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,017
by encouraging positive decision
making both online and offline.

00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:22,721
Do you want to sit back and
wonder at what could have been?

00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,956
Or do you want to stand up,
speak out,

00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,326
and join me to stop
cyber bullying forever?

00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,127
Thank you.

00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,597
So, Erica, she gets that pop‐up
message comes up...

00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,832
‐Correct.
‐ReThink.

00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:36,601
What if she just hits, "OK"?

00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,637
Can she still send it?
‐Absolutely.

00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,605
So, we're not taking away
anyone's right

00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,641
to express any of their feelings
or opinions.

00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,743
They can still post that message
if they like.

00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:47,746
So you're simply giving them
that extra time to rethink.

00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,848
But did Erica have to sign up
for your app?

00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,549
Trisha: So, that's a really
great question.

00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,685
Why would cyber bullies
download ReThink?

00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:56,621
That's why we target two main
groups ‐‐ educators and parents.

00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,757
Those are the people that are
looking right now

00:35:58,757 --> 00:35:59,991
for solutions to cyber bullying.

00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,595
I'm just very curious why
you would think of this

00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:04,596
in the first place.

00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:05,764
Tell us a little bit about
your own background.

00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:08,366
Well, I'm actually a 16‐year‐old

00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,534
high‐school junior.

00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,836
And when I was 13 years old,

00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,873
I actually came home from school
one day to read online

00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,676
about an 11‐year‐old girl
who lost her life

00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:18,977
to cyber bullying.

00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:22,447
She had been cyber‐bullied
for over a year and a half,

00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:25,583
and it just ‐‐
it really broke my heart

00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,919
to think that someone younger
than myself

00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,655
had suffered endlessly
because of an issue

00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,724
that didn't have
a better solution.

00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,926
And immediately, I wanted to be
able to make a difference.

00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,562
I wanted to use technology
to solve a problem

00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,464
that technology itself
has created.

00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,765
I cannot believe you're 16.

00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,701
‐Yeah, you carry yourself
very well.
‐You're so powerful.

00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,536
‐Thank you.
‐Trisha, have you sold any?

00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,905
So, so far, we've garnered
about $52,000

00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,973
from the We Think ReThink
Educational Program.

00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,544
Schools everywhere, because of
new state and federal laws,

00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,612
are required to monitor
and supervise

00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,815
anti‐cyber‐bullying
education in schools.

00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,684
So what we do is we actually
provide them curriculum.

00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,287
We provide them
this ReThink technology

00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:02,921
on their school devices.

00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,856
We provide them
ReThink analytics

00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,659
on how the technology
is working with students.

00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,027
We've gotten 128,000 downloads

00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,795
on both our Google Play Store
and the App Store.

00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,864
‐Through what period of time?
‐That's nine months.

00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,699
Herjavec: The amount
of downloads you've had

00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,501
is very impressive
for nine months.

00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:17,569
Thank you.

00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,703
It's a good idea,

00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,338
but there's some challenges
to it.

00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,706
And the challenge to it is

00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,709
that the user is in control
of the experience.

00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,545
In other words,
if I'm really a cyber bully,

00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:28,680
all I have to do is hit "OK,"

00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,014
and the message
still goes through.

00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,750
Trisha: When I first came up
with this idea,

00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,851
I had the same doubts
that you did.

00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,586
"What if they just hit 'no'
every time?"

00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,855
So I ended up conducting
a 1,500‐trial study,

00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:39,624
and we find that over 93%
of the time,

00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,393
when teenagers get
this ReThink alert,

00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,061
they change their mind.

00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,796
Cuban: So, let's get the proof
in the pudding, right?

00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,531
What's your daily active usage?

00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,666
So, every day,
we have about 80,000 ‐‐

00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:49,934
Who wrote all the code for it?

00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,803
So, I've actually been coding
since I was 10.

00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,738
‐Wow.
‐Something I love to do.

00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:54,839
‐You coded this?
‐Yes.

00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,442
What a tremendous
entrepreneurial talent.

00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,610
Thank you.

00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,744
I think you have a decision
to make.

00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:00,979
I think you have to decide

00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:03,748
if this is a charity
or if this is a business.

00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:08,653
I think what you have to do here
is decide that this is a charity

00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,822
and try to get money to support
the charity

00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,857
because it's certainly
a worthy cause

00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,660
and easy to convince everybody
else to believe in.

00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,929
But I really think when you want

00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,732
to start a business
that makes money,

00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:22,700
it's got to be something
totally different.

00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,336
I think you're doing
the right thing, but I'm out.

00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,372
Thank you so much, Barbara.

00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:28,706
So, obviously,
everybody agrees

00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,542
you're remarkably talented
for 16.

00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:31,743
That's fantastic.
‐Thank you.

00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:32,944
You're destined to do
something great.

00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,346
I don't know what it is yet.
You're gonna find out.

00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,447
But it's not this.

00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,682
This is not going
to make you rich.

00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,819
Taking on an investor means you
have a new responsibility.

00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,754
You have to make them money.

00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,656
And I am 100% committed
to that.

00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,158
I have never been afraid
of hard work.

00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:47,692
I'm out.

00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,829
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,798
So, I think
it's a fantastic cause.

00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,801
You, at 16,
are incredibly talented.

00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,737
But content‐filtering software's
been around

00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:00,839
for a very long time.

00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:05,310
‐Sure.
‐This really isn't that unique.

00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,578
Trying to sell it this way

00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:09,514
for people to download this
as an application ‐‐

00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,748
it's gonna be a struggle.

00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,585
I don't see it
as a business today.

00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:14,686
I'm out.

00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:15,887
I wish you all the best of luck.

00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:18,590
‐Thank you.
‐Thank you.

00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,792
What are you gonna use
the money for?

00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,494
So, the $100,000 would be used
to hire employees

00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,796
to start building infrastructure

00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:25,964
so that we can roll this out

00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:28,099
to the large scale of interest
that we have.

00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,201
The resources I have ‐‐
‐The large scale of interest?

00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,302
Like what?

00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,470
I have 1,200 schools

00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,771
that are interested
in having this

00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,640
for the upcoming 2016‐2017
school year,

00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,742
and T‐Mobile Europe,
the phone carrier,

00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,677
was interested in actually
implementing this.

00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,614
I decided I wanted this to be
more than just one carrier

00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,015
just for one region
of the world.

00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,951
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You had a carrier contact you?

00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,721
‐I did.
‐And you said no?
‐And you said no?

00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,489
Trisha: I turned it down
because at that point,

00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,624
it was a very early stage.

00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:54,726
It was just at the point
when we had launched the app.

00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,794
We were getting thousands
and thousands of downloads.

00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:57,929
I genuinely believe that this

00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,864
can be something more
than just one carrier,

00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,633
and I think
that we can get there.

00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,568
John: All right, so, I think
there is a business here.

00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,802
I'm not ‐‐
This is not about charity.

00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,472
I want to be a part of this.
I like the cause.

00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:08,640
I like the concept.

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,276
I'll give you the $100,000
for 30%.

00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,781
This happens to be
a passion of mine

00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:20,551
because I think
it's super‐important.

00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,886
I love the kind of woman

00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,821
that when her feet hit
the ground in the morning,

00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,624
the competition's like,
"Oh, crap. She's up."

00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,793
You're that woman.

00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,795
I'm gonna offer you $100,000.

00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,965
I'm gonna do it for the 20%.

00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:37,402
And I honestly wouldn't
even mind doing it

00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:39,637
with another Shark here

00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,373
because I think the more people
that are involved in it,

00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,908
the better to get the word out.

00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,743
Cuban's not out.
Mark's not out.

00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,279
‐But, Mark, you're still in.
‐Right.

00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,584
If you want to get this

00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,887
into as ubiquitous a position
as possible,

00:40:55,887 --> 00:41:00,725
working with a carrier is
by far, without any question,

00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:02,393
the best way to go.

00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,494
Absolutely.

00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:04,595
The reason for that is

00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,665
they can put it on a phone
as a default option.

00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,634
It can come pre‐installed.

00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,804
They can, then, offer it
to consumers, to parents ‐‐

00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,839
"This is
a kid‐friendly phone,"

00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,442
or, "We sell
a kid‐friendly version."

00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:18,943
Is that a viable option
to you?

00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,712
Something that
I would be open to,

00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:22,680
and with your guidance,
with your expertise,

00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,748
I can make those decisions.

00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:26,517
John:
What do you got, Mark?

00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,587
Here's my offer ‐‐

00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,889
I'll go in with Lori.
You know, we can split it.

00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,525
All right, so,
Mark is in with Lori.

00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,561
$100,000 for 20%.

00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:39,797
$50,000 from each.
Damon's $100,000 for 30%.

00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,632
Time to make a decision.

00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,967
Mark and Lori,
I'm gonna accept your offer.

00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,236
‐All right, great.
‐Thank you both so much.

00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,504
Greiner: Great.

00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,572
Congratulations.

00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:48,773
It'll be exciting
to work with you.

00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:49,774
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:51,642
‐I'm really glad.
‐Thank you.

00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:52,610
This is a passion of mine.

00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,611
Thank you so much.

00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,779
We're gonna do
a lot with it.

00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:56,247

Honestly, it's just shock waves
right now.

00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,693
I can't believe
I just made a deal

00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,661
with Mark Cuban
and Lori Greiner.

multi‐million‐dollar success,

00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,644
and I really believe with them
it is possible.
