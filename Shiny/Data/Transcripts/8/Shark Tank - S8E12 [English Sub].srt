00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:45,485
when all you'd have to do
is take your time to get there?

00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,587
We wanted
to build the company.

00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,288
We wanted to be
sitting on the inventory.

00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,423
We also looked at ‐‐

00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,691
You wanted to be sitting on
all that inventory?

00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,326
We wanted
to be prepared.
Oh.

00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,560
We wanted to be prepared.
We also knew ‐‐

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,695
We own ‐‐
We made that mistake.

00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:59,065
I feel you've been screwed
by the V. C. s, you know that?

00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,233
Wedgied.
Well...

00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,434
No, it's not that
you've been screwed.

00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,535
You screwed yourself.

00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,537
The vision's good.
The product's good.

00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:08,107
The execution is
ridiculous.

00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,543
Worst I've ever seen.

00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:14,280
We're looking
for the long haul.

00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,016
We're here because
we're building this thing

00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:17,583
to be an empire.

00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,552
We're not looking to sell it
at $10 million.

00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,354
Yeah, I ‐‐
We're looking
to go really big.

00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,157
Yeah, but it's too late!
You blew it!

00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,291
Capital management‐wise,

00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,994
you're the worst I've ever seen,
so I'm out.

00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,298
And I'm not mad at you,
I feel bad for you,

00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,300
that there's
this great opportunity

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,369
that you created,
and it went "Pshew!"

00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,270
Well, I'm mad at you.

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,538
And that's why we're ‐‐
That's why we're here today.

00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:39,605
We want to make you
a lot of money.

00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,140
You can't!
Herjavec:
No, but you can't!

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,774
We can!
Michael: You can't!

00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,509
Guys, this is
a basic business.
Why can't we?

00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,911
You know what, look.
Michael...

00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,513
This is a basics business ‐‐
$76 billion.
... great business,
great idea.

00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,583
But you cannot make a mistake
that's gonna kill you.

00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:54,220
When you give away 75%,
you're dead.

00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,522
You don't own this business
anymore.

00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,424
I'm not talking
to the owner.

00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,260
I'm talking
to the hired help.

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,130
It's crazy.

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,365
I'm out.

00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,267
So, guys,
I love this stuff.

00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,402
The quality is amazing.

00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:12,271
I just knew I could put
my Bombas socks in there,

00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,474
and they have online,
and it was gonna be great,

00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,676
but you don't have enough equity
in the company.

00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,345
You're gonna be miserable here,
and when you dropped that bomb

00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,415
of you not having
that percentage...

00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,218
it just hurt me,
actually, for you.

00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,819
So, I'm out.

00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:32,725
Guys, I look at this, uh,
this problem a different way.

00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,128
It doesn't make sense
to take any of your equity

00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,130
if I were to be an investor.

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,499
Here's an offer for you.

00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,301
I would give you $125,000.

00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:46,506
I want 25%, but I want the whole
25% to come out of them.

00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,176
I wouldn't do the deal if
you told me he was deluding you,

00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,078
because if you don't have 25%,

00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,279
you don't have skin in the game.

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,547
But how can they
make that deal, Kevin?

00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,882
We're here
on their behalf.

00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,550
You know,
I'll tell you something ‐‐
When you came in ‐‐

00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,751
Guys, that's
an offer, okay?

00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,486
Thank you.
I appreciate the offer.
Thank you.

00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:04,123
You know, I love
to copy Mr. Wonderful.

00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,492
I will do $125,000

00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:10,396
for the 25% that
you get out of your investors.

00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,632
I'm doing it because I think
that the product is fantastic.

00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,433
So basically,
you've made the same offer.

00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,470
I crafted
the deal for you.

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,705
I would love to ask
if either of you

00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:26,546
would want to come down to...
15% for $125,000.

00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,116
Because we are
negotiating for them.

00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:32,151
We value them
as investors,

00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,686
and we value you guys
as investors,

00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,454
and we love the way
you're structuring,

00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,589
and we appreciate
that you care.

00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,357
O'Leary: I've just realized,
listening to you ‐‐

00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,526
you actually
can't make this deal.

00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,595
I'm dealing with a ghost
that's not in the room,

00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,164
and that's the problem
with your structure.

00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,034
You simply don't own enough.

00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,002
I'm out.

00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,371
Appreciate it.

00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,473
Can you even negotiate?

00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,575
What you want to do,
Lori?

00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,476
You're talking about somebody
else's equity.

00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,246
I know you were
countering back at 15%.

00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,415
I will go 20%,
but that's it.

00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,517
And you really have to
think about

00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,452
whether or not they would
even consider this.

00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,587
Wouldn't do it, Lori.

00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,021
Let's make a deal.
Let's make a deal.

00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,090
‐20%?
‐But how can they do the deal?
‐But you have to check with your
investors first.

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,460
You have to check
with your investors.
You don't have the right
to make the deal!

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,295
We have the right.
We're here with their blessing.

00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,532
So you think that your investors
are going to say,

00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:24,270
"It's okay ‐‐ 20%. I will
give it away out of my cut."

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,438
100%.
You're positive?

00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,706
We're not ‐‐
We're not positive.
I'm positive.
I'm positive.

00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,341
‐Really?
‐Oh.
‐Ah.
‐There you go.

00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,575
O'Leary: They've said yes.
What do you want to do?

00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,210
Well,
what does that mean?!

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,179
It's Lori's call.
Look, it's Lori's call.

00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,680
I mean, Lori...

00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,284
Lori, I think it would
close with a lot more certainty

00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,920
if we could get this equity down
a little bit more.

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,590
‐Oh!
‐Oh, my ‐‐ Gaah!
‐Okay! Okay! Okay!
‐All right, I'm sorry.

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,192
Greiner: You know what?
We really ‐‐

00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,393
This seems very tenuous.

00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,461
We're ‐‐
We really ‐‐

00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,730
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to go out.

00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,432
We really want
to make a deal with you.

00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,502
To make that deal,
you needed 51%.
Yep.

00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,270
You're an employee,
both of you.

00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,505
No, we're here
with their s‐‐

00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,408
You're here,
but you're still employees.

00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,443
Thank you so much.
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for listening.

00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,779
We appreciate it.
Appreciate all your time.

00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,351
Wow. You could feel
the air leave the tank...

00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,986
Boom.
... as soon as they said
they sold 75%.

00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,454
Yeah, I could see ‐‐ I was
hitting her with this stuff,

00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,356
I could see her face
just start to drop.

00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,125
That kind of made me sick.

00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,294
Michael:
We don't think it's a mistake

00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,430
that we gave up 75%
of our company.

00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,434
We have 25% of a company
that's going to be huge.

00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,836
And we're
really proud of that.

00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,808
In season six,
Naushad Ali made a deal

00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,178
with Robert Herjavec
for his clogged drain solution,

00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,312
Drain Strain.

00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,181
$110,000,
but I want 10%.

00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,215
I'd love
to do a deal with you.

00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,250
Done!

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,186
Narrator:
Let's see what he's doing now.

00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,287
Hey, Naushad,
how are you?

00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,588
Ali:
When I appeared on "Shark Tank,"

00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,590
Drain Strain was just
a prototype.

00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,726
We launched it retail
just three months ago,

00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,595
and we're generating
tremendous sales and interest.

00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,131
So, we got the Drain Strain
sink stopper.

00:19:59,131 --> 00:19:59,832
I love the packaging.

00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:03,636
In 2008, my family lost
everything including our home,

00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,172
and we ended up moving
into a rental.

00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,207
It was ironically
in that rental home

00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,475
that our drains clogged

00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,544
and was the eureka moment
for Drain Strain.

00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,612
You've come a long way,
my friend.

00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,182
Since "Shark Tank,"
we're now available

00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,616
in 1,200 Home Depot stores,

00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,519
and we have a purchase order
for 500 Lowe's stores.

00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,621
When I was on "Shark Tank,"
we were pre‐revenue.

00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,623
We've launched in retail
just three months ago

00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,560
and generated $. 5 million
in sales.

00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,595
And then
here's our bathtub prototype.

00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,730
Herjavec:
What I've learned from Naushad

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,565
is this is the greatest country
in the world.

00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:36,035
Everybody gets a second chance
if you're willing to work hard.

00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,369
Naushad was at rock bottom,

00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,906
and a few years later,
he's in 1,200 Home Depot stores?

00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,007
Hallelujah.

00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,377
Look at that.
Right at the end of an aisle.

00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,612
This is just the beginning.

00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:50,182
Today, Drain Strain ‐‐ tomorrow,
every drain in your house

00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,418
with an entire
Drain Strain section.

00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,486
I can see it.

00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,621
The only thing left to do
is get more locations.

00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,423
Well, let's do it.
Let's go work on that.

00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,425
Ali: My family has endured
a lot of emotional

00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,261
and financial challenges
over the last several years.

00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,529
This has allowed me
to bounce back

00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,197
and make my dreams come true

00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,999
and leave a legacy
for my children.

Narrator:
Next into the tank

00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,046
is a patriotic take
on a favorite beverage.

00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,423
Hello, sharks.
My name is Cade Courtley.

00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,359
This is Ms. Betty Bean.

00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,497
And I'm here asking for $250,000
for 20% equity.

00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,534
Now, as a former Navy Seal,
a sniper,

00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:42,735
and a security contractor,

00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,137
I worked in some of
the most hostile places

00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,405
on this planet.

00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:51,443
Places like Bosnia, places like
Iraq and Afghanistan ‐‐

00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,245
the kind of places
you're literally living

00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,513
one hour at a time.

00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,383
And things can go upside‐down
just like that.

00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,485
Trust me when I tell you
when you're working

00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,320
in an environment like that,

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,722
you crave just
a little sense of normalcy.

00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:08,027
Now for me, that was
a damn good cup of coffee.

00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,532
And that's why
I started Victory Coffees.

00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,467
That, and it beats the hell out
of getting shot at.

00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,336
[ Laughter ]
Now, Victory Coffees is

00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,605
a veteran‐owned
and veteran‐operated company

00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:23,609
whose only mission is
to deliver you amazing coffee.

00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,679
Simply choose
one of our organically grown,

00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,282
fairly traded,
premium international blends.

00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:33,252
You can get it in whole bean.

00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:36,088
You can get it ground.

00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,389
And we are proud to announce

00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,726
that we have
the world's strongest K‐Cups.

00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,162
Thank you, Betty.
[ Laughter ]

00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,597
And that's it!

00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:48,234
So, folks,
life is too short,

00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,502
so why not start your day
with a victory?

00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,138
Now, Ms. Betty Bean
is going to deliver you each

00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,473
two cups of coffee.

00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,442
The one that you prefer,
if you wouldn't mind

00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,310
slipping that mug forward,
please.

00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,712
Herjavec:
I love coffee.

00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,249
We have your initials
on the front of each mug.

00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:06,151
Oh, thank you.

00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,120
Betty Boop.

00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:10,890
I like this one.

00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,192
O'Leary:
You're taking a lot of risk with
this blind taste test thing.

00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,460
Courtley: Yeah.
You know what?

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,296
He's a former sniper.
He over it.

00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:18,697
He's used to risk.
I mean, you know.

00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:23,102
There is coffee risk, and then
there's getting blown up risk.

00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,803
So, the one in the white cups ‐‐

00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,641
that's one of the country's
leading coffee sellers in that.

00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:31,543
So, the folks that said,
"Hey, we like the gray one."

00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,412
We have a better product
than one of

00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,547
the biggest coffee companies
in the United States right now.

00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:39,852
Okay, I chose the gray,
which is yours, darker.
Yes, sir.

00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:40,519
Lori?

00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,688
Greiner: I do think that yours
has a nicer flavor

00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:45,324
for being a very heavy,
dark coffee.

00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:46,525
Kevin,
what did you choose?

00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:50,829
I chose the darker cup,
the gray cup, as you did.

00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,965
'Cause you're a connoisseur
like I.
Of course.

00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:53,599
Daymond?

00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,501
I'll be very honest.
I tried them both,

00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,369
and because I'm ‐‐ I mean,
I'm not a coffee drinker,

00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,071
I can't tell the difference.

00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:01,040
And Mark?

00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,774
I like mine light.

00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,476
I don't like real heavy, dark,
dark coffee at all.

00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,578
Where's the coffee
come from?

00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,214
So, we source from Central
and South America,

00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,649
Africa, and Sumatra.

00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,218
So, what made you choose
to go into something

00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,254
that has such
a competitive field?

00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:16,588
Well...
Was it Betty Bean?

00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,424
[ Laughter ]
I would tell you ‐‐

00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:20,359
I would tell you
that 83% of Americans

00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,195
are drinking the stuff,
so I'm looking at

00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,364
potentially
268 million customers,

00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:27,433
and 56% of those folks admit
to being addicted to it.

00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,701
Cuban:
Yeah. Okay, so, before...

00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,302
Cade, Cade, Cade.
We're gonna save you some time.

00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,204
I'm gonna save you
some time, right?
Yes, sir.

00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,440
Rule number one
to "Shark Tank" is

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,508
when you talk about
market size...
Mm‐hmm.

00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,644
... and start to suggest, "If I
only get a small percentage,

00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,646
then I'm gonna make a killing,"
that's like ‐‐

00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,481
‐That's scary for us.
‐Yeah, we hate that, Cade.
‐That's ‐‐ Yeah.

00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,250
Yeah, that's a big red flag
because it does everything

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,618
but put the focus
on your business

00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,687
and the execution
of your business.
Okay.

00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:52,191
So, much more importantly is not
what's the size of the market,

00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,592
because we know
people drink coffee.

00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,661
What's the size
of your business?

00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,297
Let me tell you
how Victory's different with ‐‐

00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,498
Let's say you have two cups.

00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,301
It's the exact same price,
exact same quality,

00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,436
exact same convenience.
But why is your ‐‐

00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,704
What's my differentiator?
Yeah.

00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,341
Do not underestimate the power
of patriotism in this country.

00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,210
But that gets you
in the door, right?
Yeah.

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,244
Thank you
for your service.

00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,379
I don't want
to diminish that,

00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,314
'cause there's
nothing more ‐‐
You were worth it.

00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,016
Yeah, there's nothing
more important.

00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,183
But on the busi‐‐

00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,220
Now, back to
the business side of it.

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,288
Okay, you're
gonna get in the door.

00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,623
Then what happens?

00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,492
I just got
a major purchase order

00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:29,194
from one of the biggest
insurance agencies

00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,362
in this country.

00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,431
So, what you're ‐‐
what you're telling us is

00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:35,267
you're selling
on a direct commercial basis

00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,336
to large companies.

00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:39,505
That's the business‐to‐business
side of the house.

00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:43,175
I initially began this company
as the business‐to‐consumer,

00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,376
and it was basically

00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,478
a subscription‐based
coffee company.
Online?

00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,213
Yes, sir.
And how did you do?

00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,248
What are your sales?

00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,449
We have year‐to‐date sales
right now

00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:53,252
of $30,000,
$0 advertising.

00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,320
That's direct to consumer?
Yes, it is.

00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,222
And that's over
what period of time?

00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,657
That's over a period
of eight months.

00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,359
Okay,
let's really drill down

00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,727
into what you
actually have created,

00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,363
because I'm going to
make the assumption ‐‐

00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:05,898
because I'm familiar
with the whole sourcing

00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:09,468
of coffee business ‐‐ You're not
<i>really</i> sourcing it yourself.

00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,403
You're dealing
with a distributor.

00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,306
I'm not, I went directly
to two of my Marine buddies

00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,774
who set up shop
in Washington, D. C.,

00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,510
and have been making coffee
for about three years.

00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,679
O'Leary: So, you're only
buying beans from a ‐‐
They're roasters, Cade.

00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,348
‐You yourself ‐‐
‐They actually ‐‐
‐No, no, he's going
through the roaster.

00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,484
You're not buying
the coffee directly.

00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:29,555
So, what you're really creating
is a marketing company.

00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,257
You're right.
The coffee's
the same coffee

00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,425
that you can get
from other people.

00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,561
And you're absolutely right,
and that's why I was able

00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:38,097
to get three major corporations
to decide,

00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,031
"We're going to switch to this."

00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:39,765
Cade, how
do you scale that?

00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,267
Because most of the coffee
bought in corporations

00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,036
is done
through third parties.

00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,270
I'm glad you asked.

00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,338
One of the things
I want to create

00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,307
is what I call
the Victory Army.

00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,309
And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to recruit,

00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:54,513
train, equip, and deploy
an all‐veteran sales force.

00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:55,781
And this is how
we're gonna scale.

00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:59,451
And it's basically iconic
American businesses for ‐‐

00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,686
You're trying to do
too much, Cade.

00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,621
You're trying
to do too much.
Yeah, you're ‐‐

00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,423
These are all ideas.
You haven't executed them yet.

00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,657
I'm just trying to sell.
I know. I know.

00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,392
I'm just trying to sell.
You're a great
salesperson, right?

00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,361
You've got the heart.
You've got the determination.

00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,630
But what you don't have
is focus right now.

00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,466
You can sell. You believe.
You've got the heart.

00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,268
You know you're doing
the right thing.

00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:19,071
That is an amazing skill
that not everybody has.

00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,339
Just do that.
Mm‐hmm.

00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,208
Everything else is
a complication. Just sell.

00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,144
Okay.
I'm out.

00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:29,414
You know, you picked coffee
because it's popular,

00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,450
and you know that there's
a good market for it.

00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,753
But the double‐edged sword is
is that at the same time,

00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,023
there's a million people
out there making coffee

00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,291
and selling coffee.

00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,559
They own the market.

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,128
I always say
it's best to do something

00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,963
that's a little bit different.

00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,798
I'm out.

00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,369
I appreciate what you say
about how competitive

00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,570
and tough this is.

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,340
Sharks, I spent half of my life
making bad guys go away.

00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,609
There's no way I'm gonna do
an attitude shift

00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,479
from surviving
countless operations

00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,348
in places like Afghanistan,
and give up

00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,585
because somebody might not like
my light roast.

00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:07,719
That's just not the way
I do business.

00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,421
It is not even ‐‐ It is not even
a question of that.

00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,589
It's not a question
of your character.
Uh‐huh.

00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,191
Not at all.
It's not a question
of your character.

00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,292
There is
no issue with you

00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,593
making sure that you're gonna
get the job done.

00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:16,695
But you're just
a little too early ‐‐

00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,564
Maybe I can explain
a little bit more about ‐‐

00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:21,166
You're gonna have to explain
to them. I'm out.

00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,434
Thanks for your time.

00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,468
O'Leary: Look ‐‐
Yes.

00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,504
Everybody said
the same thing.

00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:28,240
Nobody doubts you,
it's just way to early.

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,043
It's not investable
yet, Cade.

00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,244
I'm out.

00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:33,478
All right, thank you.

00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,614
Cade, do you know
what the number 242 is?

00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:37,349
And I love this.
I love this story.

00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,384
I learned this
a long time ago.
No, I don't.

00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,154
That's the amount
of venture‐capital firms

00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,622
that Howard Schultz
went to

00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,757
before he got funding
for Starbucks.

00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:49,561
Who would've had the courage
to get up a 243rd time?

00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,496

what's wrong with you?

so that way
I can be beautiful."

And we were, like,
totally devastated, you know?

00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,684
You're right.
We were devastated.

00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,687
And for us, we were thinking, as
parents, what did we do wrong?

00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,690
And she just kept looking
at all the dolls and characters

00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,860
that she constantly sees on TV
and in the stores,

00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,730
and Jason and I really searched
high and low for a doll

00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,399
that would be a positive
affirmation for our daughter,

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,634
and we found nothing.

00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:56,668
I mean,
we went to every store.

00:33:56,668 --> 00:34:00,338
So, from there, of course,
we thought,

00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,640
"Well, let's just create
a doll on our own."

00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,575
So, we created
the Angelica doll

00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:07,579
with just an initial investment
of $1,500.

00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,748
So, after we saw the change
in my daughter

00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,784
in just a couple weeks
with affirmations in the doll,

00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,254
we really thought,
"Could this help other people?"

00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:21,159
We launched Angelica
May 2015,

00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,295
sold out our inventory
in December,

00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,130
and then we launched
four other dolls.

00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,364
What did you sell it for?

00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,767
We're retailing them
at $85 right now.

00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,802
‐Oh, that's ‐‐
‐That's high‐end.
‐And what did it cost you?

00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,238
‐That's pretty expensive.
‐Yeah.
‐That seems like a lot
for a doll.

00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,574
Right. So, we did
a very small production run,

00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,578
only 1,000 units, so right now,
our cost of goods sold

00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,581
is $35,
which is very high.

00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,450
And that's one reason why we're
here today for an investment,

00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,619
because with an investment,
we can get that cost down.

00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,421
Did you get orders
from retailers?
So, we had ‐‐

00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,523
Of course, we had interest
from large retailers.

00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:55,460
But they want our retail price
to come down to $35, $40.

00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,661
That's what they want.
Max.

00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,130
Exactly.
And that's below
your cost today.

00:34:59,130 --> 00:34:59,698
Exactly.

00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,299
For you to get down
to that price point,

00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,767
you got to change
everything.
Right.

00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:06,171
Well, we've done a bit of
the legwork on that right now.

00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,239
We're in contact
with a new manufacturer

00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,341
that's already
seen the doll,

00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:10,442
already did a price point
for it.

00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,476
What's their capacity?

00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:14,245
$10.30, so
our new profit margin would be

00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,413
somewhere
around 81, 82%.

00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,482

personal to us

00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,336
that little girls
can walk down a toy aisle

00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,604
and see themselves.

00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:16,341
So, I think eventually, when we
can handle mass production

00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,443
and going into retail,
we do want to go that route.

00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,478
Angelica, I think
that there's the problem.

00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,647
And I understand
that might make you feel good...
Right.

00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:26,351
... and maybe affirmative, but
I think there's the challenge.

00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,352
Mm‐hmm.
Mm‐hmm.

00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,586
You know,
the big companies,

00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,489
they can create in mass volumes
that you can't get to.

00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,158
And that's not being negative.

00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:33,758
Right.
No, it's the truth.

00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,460
It's just the reality
of where you are.
Right.

00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,062
You know, you got to be honest
with yourself...

00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:37,562
Mm‐hmm.
Mm‐hmm.

00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,164
... where your
starting point is.

00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,265
Right.
Mm‐hmm.

00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:42,734
So, from
that starting point, to say,

00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,236
"We're gonna go into retail.
We're gonna get to mass volume.

00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,671
We're gonna get to
that price point."

00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,207
Wow,
that's an uphill battle.
Right.

00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,110
I admire you guys,
but I just can't see it.

00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,178
That's
really unfortunate.

00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,979
I can't see that path.
I'm out.

00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:55,580
Okay.
Thank you.

00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,148
But thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,450
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,819
You know, the good news is
people have been concerned about

00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:04,589
the doll being replaced
by technology for 20 years now.

00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,193
Mattel still does over 2 billion
a year of the Barbie brand.

00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:09,427
It's huge.
Yeah.
Yes.

00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,296
I know all this 'cause I was one
of their largest shareholders

00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,630
for a long time.

00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,568
And it was challenging to see
others try and pursue niches.

00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:20,472
I think there is a place for you
direct to your customer.

00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:23,274
A $10 million business
would make your family

00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,210
$1.5 million a year.

00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,412
But I've lived
this life already,

00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,882
and I didn't love it
in the end.

00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,250
I'm out.

00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,418

Sorry to hear that.

Guys, let me jump in.
Okay.

You guys are still
about the dream

00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,724
in a lot of respects,
right?
Mm‐hmm.

00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,694
My suggestion to you is
get on project green.

00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,596
You know, the whole thing
about the vision,

00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:48,233
when you walk down the aisles
you want to see your dolls.
Right.

00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,834
That complicates things
in a big way.

00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:53,371
You've got something
that's very unique to you...
Mm‐hmm.

00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,173
... and that's working
for you.
Right.

00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,441
Leverage that.
Follow the green.

00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,210
Right now, you're a little bit
too scattered for me.

00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,445
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,148
But congratulations. You've done
an amazing job getting here.

00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:04,215
Thank you very much.

to your focus factor.

I'm a man with a family.

every day.

Jason and Angelica's last chance

for a deal for their
multi‐cultural doll company,

Naturally Perfect Dolls.

00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,586
I'm wrestling with the idea.
I really am.

00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,454
Angelica:
Well, Daymond, let me say this.

00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,356
We really tried
to replicate features

00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,658
that are true
to women of color.

00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,494
Our original Angelica doll
actually was sculpted

00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,363
from my face
and my daughter's face, as well.

00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,433
They're also very unique
because of our messaging.

00:38:55,433 --> 00:39:00,104
People really relate to us,
our story, and our why.

00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,439
I understand that.
I‐I‐‐

00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,540
That's why I'm wrestling
with it,

00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,144
because I think
I resonate with this, of course.

00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:07,378
I‐I have three daughters.

00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,381
I have a newborn now.

00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,251
And my daughters are ‐‐
They're mixed.

00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,286
So, I want them
to feel beautiful.

00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,487
But the biggest challenge
I have

00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,356
is probably
what everybody else had here.

00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,124
Why retail?

00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,526
Well, let me clarify.

00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,261
I started off saying
that we love

00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,562
the direct
to consumer model.

00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,698
And we definitely want
to stick to that.

00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:31,569
But I said as we grow, and maybe
we're a $20 million company,

00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,404
and we can afford
to go in retail,

00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,606
then maybe
that's the avenue.

00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:37,575
I believe that it's about
business health.

00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,178
We might have all these
fantastic goals,

00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,946
but what's doable is
what's doable.

00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:42,580
I have a family.

00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,450
I mean, we might have
the biggest dreams in the world,

00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,452
but while we keep
this dream on par,

00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:49,220
we know ‐‐
we have to build a business,

00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,488
and we have to be
sensible about it.

00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,390
If you're willing
to bend like that,

00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,659
then I'll give you
an offer.

00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:58,496
I'll give you $200,000
