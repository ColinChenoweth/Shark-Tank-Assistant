Cuban: So,
the big question is ‐‐

00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,886
Where can you get
your EBITDA to ‐‐

00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,154
or, actually,
your net margins to?

00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:57,022
So, the target
for next year,

00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,226
we'd be in the high
single digits for EBITDA,

00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,794
and then the year after that,
in the mid‐teens.

00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:02,862
‐So, give me an example.
‐So, what changes?

00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:03,829
So you're marketing is a
percentage of sales?

00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,731
That's a $4 million year,
right?

00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,966
5‐ish.

00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:10,069
What do you think you'll make
on the $5 million model?

00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:13,806
$5 million, we're gonna make
about $400,000 and change.

00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,875
You're gonna make
$400,000 pre‐tax,

00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,143
$300,000 after tax?
Ish.

00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,745
You're basically asking me
to value it

00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,047
at 18 times
sales two years from now.

00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,983

that you got to answer.
Sure.

00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,987

it's a brilliant product.

It obviously
fills a need,

certain outlets

that really are
your core customers.
Yeah.

00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,165
They don't really match with,
historically, my businesses,

00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:42,034
and it's certainly not tech,
so I'm gonna say I'm out.

00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:42,968
‐Okay.
‐Thank you.

00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,270
‐Thanks, Mark. Yeah.
‐Mm‐hmm.

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,139
I'm really struggling
with the valuation,
I got to tell you.

00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,943
I'm gonna have to wait years
to get my money back.

00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:51,911
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐It depends

00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,579
on who wants
to buy the company.

00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,079
But that's my only exit.

00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,882
I give you $250,000 for 5%.

00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,118
You're gonna have to grow
this thing geometrically

00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,720
before the distributions
ever pay me back.

00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:05,057
Let's be realistic here.
Yeah.

00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,927
I think it's reasonable that
this gets to $10 million, okay?

00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,028
You've already proven it,

00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:11,063
and you've got retailers
that want to do it.

00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,900
You're gonna make $800,000
on that, pre‐tax,

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,803
so after tax, $600K.

00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,839
And I own 5%.

00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,842
I make $30,000
three years from now

00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,811
on my $250,000 investment,

00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,413
assuming
<i>everything</i> goes right.

00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:30,382
Well, what if the business
is sold for $20 million,
and you have 5% equity?

00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,886
‐Is that ‐‐ that doesn't even ‐‐
‐How do see what you're selling?

00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,155

How do see
you're selling this

for a large amount of money
down the road?

00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,193
So, that's
a great question.

00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,662
So, we're building
a category at retail,

00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,296
going
into specialty retail

00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,699
and creating a category
they never had before

00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,900
that allows them
to make money.

00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,768
We can create an ecosystem
around that.

00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:50,936
We can add
other products.

We've got heaters,
we've got field‐fill kits,

Can I say something,
though, too?

00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,947
Like, when we built the forecast
models for this business,

00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,215

any big‐box.

of my valuation.

00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,207
Because I was gonna say,
you know, I'm watching this,

00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,776

<i>like</i> this.

00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,911

my products.

to go from, you know, nothing

last year?

I developed the Smart Cart.

00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,954

you need a new product,

you come up with
a product that works.

00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:58,723
Well, the reason
I came out with it

00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,858
is because, in California,

00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,993
they had legislation
banning plastic bags,

00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,863
and I knew at that point
I wanted to develop a cart

00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,364
that weighed less, held more,
folded thinner.

00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:09,167
John:
Is this your biggest‐selling
product that you've had

Smart Cart?
Yes. Yes.

00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,272
Because the way we're looking
at you is that, you know,

00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,142
you're here for basically
somebody to help finance

00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:20,845
not only this,
but ongoing orders

00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,814
and grow the business
off of that.

00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:23,882
Right

00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:24,883

an offer.

the $350,000 for 15%,

00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,189
and then I'll take you
into Samsung in my deal.

00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,625
That means
warehousing, shipping,

00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:34,759
distribution, returns ‐‐

00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:35,927

Yeah, so it values your company
at $1.5 million.

00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,720

Yeah. You're worth
at least $4 million,

too much equity.

Sales you can't take now because
you don't have the cash?

So, as of this moment,
it's about $1 million.

00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,901
So now you give up
that extra 20%.

00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,303

of your company increase

00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,839

take that capital?

00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:35,807
