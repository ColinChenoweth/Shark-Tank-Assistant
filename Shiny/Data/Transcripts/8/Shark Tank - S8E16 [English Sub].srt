So I'd like to be
your equal partner.

00:41:04,393 --> 00:41:08,463
You realize both the offers
are the same valuation.

00:41:08,463 --> 00:41:09,564
In the case of Robert,

00:41:09,564 --> 00:41:12,668
he's paying you
twice as much for 100%.

00:41:12,668 --> 00:41:14,603
Lori wants to be
a 50‐50 partner.

00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:17,606
But, Niki,
we're not kicking you out.

00:41:17,606 --> 00:41:18,740
‐Right, that would ‐‐
‐We want you to stay,

00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,443
and we'd hire you
as a designer.

00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:22,644
I'm giving you the opportunity

00:41:22,644 --> 00:41:24,513
to do the things you like.
‐Okay.

00:41:24,513 --> 00:41:26,415
Can I ask a question?

00:41:26,415 --> 00:41:29,117
‐Of course.
‐You're allowed to talk, Niki.

00:41:29,117 --> 00:41:31,853
W‐Wh...

00:41:31,853 --> 00:41:35,190
I don't have any questions.
I know what I need to do.

Well, you're a great designer.

That was so crazy!
Oh, my gosh.

00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:11,827
I decided to go with Lori today

00:42:11,827 --> 00:42:16,732
because she voiced
my vision for the company.

00:42:16,732 --> 00:42:19,601
She saw the market.
She agreed.

00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:22,804
And I can't sell my company

00:42:22,804 --> 00:42:26,141
to somebody who doesn't agree
with my vision.
