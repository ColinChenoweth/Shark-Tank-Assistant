00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,495
Our software
automates everything.

00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,563
We control the lighting,

00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,864
the watering,
and the plant food,

00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,568
so you can have fresh herbs,
vegetables, and even flowers

00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,702
all year round

00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,970
right in the comfort
of your own home.

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,040
Our app guides you
through the entire process.

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,378
There's no dirt, so you just
add water, plant food,

00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,612
drop in your seed pods,

00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,015
and our technology
takes care of the rest.

00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,718
The wall garden's designed
to be an engaging experience

00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,754
that breathes life
into your home

00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,723
and makes gardening fun again
for the entire family.

00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,925
I'd like to hand out
some samples of our seed pods

00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,228
and then dive
into some questions.

00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,296
Okay.

00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,733
So, I got you each
a seed pod.

00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,634
All right.
Thank you.

00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:36,568
Yeah.

00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,736
Greiner: Thank you.

00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,672
Appreciate that.
Thank you, Kevin.

00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,639
Anything for you,
Robert.

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,707
‐Thank you, sir.
‐Not a problem.

00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,710
So, Ryan,
do I have to use your pods,

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,844
or can I just
put my own seeds

00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,079
into this little
plastic thing again?

00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,749
Yeah, so our goal is to have
a great user experience,

00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:51,850
so you can use our pods.

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,985
They're gonna be delivered.

00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,953
It's extremely simple
to operate,

00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,889
but if you want to plant
your own seeds, you can.

00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,758
How would you say you're
different from AeroGardens?

00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,728
So, for one, we have
an absolutely beautiful design,

00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,996
but we also have
intelligence.

00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,899
So the idea is that
while this is operating,

00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,101
we can perfect the growth
of different types of plants.

00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,604
So, that's kind of the power
of the Edn operating system.

00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,672
And how much
does it cost?

00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,974
So, the cost is $499
for the large unit,

00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:18,577
and then the small unit
is $99,

00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,612
which I call that
the gateway garden.

00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:21,847
How much
do the pods cost, Ryan?

00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,849
The pods ‐‐
so $12 subscription per month,

00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,485
and we've got
an 82% margin on those.

00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,753
So the subscription service

00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,022
is to kind of continually
bring in new plants.

00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,724
Do I have to buy
the subscription service?

00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,758
You do not, no.

00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:33,792
Do you get to choose
what your plants are?

00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,827
‐You do, yes.
‐Okay.

00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,795
Ryan,
do I buy this online?

00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,931
Yeah, so right now,
we sell direct to consumer.

00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,567
And then in the future,
when we get our prices down,

00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:42,735
we want to go
big‐box retail.

00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,903
Just this last winter,
we ran a campaign

00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,406
where we did
$10,000 worth of sales

00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:47,906
in just five days.

00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,876
I was actually online
this summer

00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,778
looking at
alternative products

00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,514
just to grow cilantro
[chilantro]

00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,715
'cause I like to have
fresh cilantro.

00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:57,716
That's one
of my shticks.

00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,752
‐Did you say "chilantro"?
‐Cilantro.

00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,287
Whatever.
I ‐‐ I like it.

00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:02,788
Cilantro.

00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,923
And there was
tons and tons

00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:09,695
of consumer,
small‐based hydroponic labs.
Right.

00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,698
What you're adding to the story
is the design feel,

00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,733
but I saw stuff
as cheap as 40 bucks.

00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,770
I think what differentiates us
is the design, of course,

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,138
but then also the technology.

00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:23,675
The name Edn actually stands for
"Environmental Data Network."

00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:24,910
And the vision of Edn

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,547
is to perfect the growth
of any type of plant.

00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,948
Ryan, you need somebody
on this journey

00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:34,253
that enjoys plants and shares
in this passion with you.

00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:34,820
Yeah.

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,723
It's just not my thing.
I'm out.

00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,757
Well, I appreciate it,
nonetheless.

00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:39,792
‐Yep.
‐Thank you.

00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,959
Ryan, I'm in the same ballpark
as Robert.

00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,797
I tried to grow a cactus,
and it lasted about a day.

00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:49,001
It's just ‐‐ it's not an area
I have a feel for, so I'm out.

00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,537
Really appreciate it, Mark.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ryan.

00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,906
This becomes
so technological.

00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,875
I worry if it takes a lot
of the soul out of the process,

00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,711
and I ‐‐ that's a weird thing
to hear from the technology guy.

00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,814
One of the first things I say
is "Where's your app?

00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:02,981
What's your
app strategy?"
Right.

00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,583
And this is one
of those companies

00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,784
where I ask,
"Why the app?"
Right.

00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,686
I actually don't think
it's that necessary.
Right.

00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:08,787
I think there's
a niche business

00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,889
for people who are
geeking out over the data,

00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,991
but I don't think that's
that's gonna help you sell

00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,260
hundreds of thousands
of these.

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,761
I'm out.

00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,730
Appreciate it, Chris.

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,532
I'll tell you where
I'm at with it, Ryan.

00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,868
Um, I'm intrigued.

00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,837
I can help you
get this into retail ‐‐

00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,839
the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
the Target, the Walmarts,

00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,941
but this price point isn't
gonna work for those guys.

00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,742
It's gonna have to be
a different price point.

00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,778
Maybe a more
dumbed‐down product.

00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,214
I'll do the deal
$150,000 for 15%.

00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,050
You know, I understand it's more
than you wanted to give up...
Wow.

00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,819
...but I'm so valuable
it's ridiculous.
That's shocking.

00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,821
That's actually
a really good offer.
Yeah.

00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,056
What is the light
doing to you?

00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,892
No, I just ‐‐ I think it's ‐‐
I'm intrigued, I'm intrigued.

00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,660
And I can definitely help you
in distribution.

00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,563
Well, Ryan ‐‐
Greiner:
I have another question.

00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:55,000
I never get to grow things.
I'm always traveling.
Woltz: Right.

00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,005
So if you said that I could
be gone for weeks at a time

00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,809
and that the light would stay on
and it would stay watered

00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,777
and I wouldn't come home
and everything's dead,

00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,314
because of your technology,
because of my app.
Right.

00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,415
Is that the case?

00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,516
Yeah,
so that's the case.

00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:12,751
It's made for people who travel,
people who ‐‐

00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,919
Ryan, I don't want
to listen to Lori anymore.

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,821
So what if I'm gone
for a month?
I made you an offer.

00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,022
You have
to make a decision.

00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,590
I'll do the deal
I just gave you.
Herjavec: Ooh.

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,858
Well, let me ‐‐ let me
just finish.

00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,727
I don't want to li‐‐
I don't want to compete.
I want to hear.

00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,861
And I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:26,365
If she drops out,
it's going up to 25%.

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,935
I'm gonna
make you an offer,

00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,703
but I'm gonna do
a conditional offer.

00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,505
‐Okay.
‐Okay?

00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,476
$150,000 for 25%.

00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,777
[ Laughs ]

00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,012
But I'm gonna
tell you why.

00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,482
Because I think ‐‐
No, no, I'm now at 25%.
That's official.

00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,951
‐Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.
‐It's beautiful ‐‐ wait.

00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,786
There's an offer of 15% ‐‐
Not anymore.

00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:51,189
Wait, wait.
It's beautiful ‐‐
Lori poisoned your deal.

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,894
The reason why is because I need
to take over manufacturing...
Okay.

00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,063
...so that you can get
this cost way down.

00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,665
Because you want
to blow these out.
Right.

00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:00,799
You want these
in every home.
Right.

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,801
You want people
to be able to afford it.
Right.

00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,671
And at $500,
it's not affordable.

00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,907
But I think we could probably
get it slashed in half.

00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,542
Isn't that
what you said, Kevin?
And that's
what's important.

00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,777
That's exactly
what I said.

00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,745
Ryan, you know what I think
the most important thing is ‐‐

00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,213
getting a deal!
Yes, hey, I ‐‐ I agree.

00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,882
I just want
to hear everybody out.
Greiner: It is important
getting a deal.

00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,651
And just so we're clear, Ryan,
I have no contingencies.

00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,953
Of course
I want the price down.

00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,622
I will help you there,
but it's not a contingency.

00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,589
So, Kevin ‐‐

00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:26,925
My offer
is $150,000 for 25%.

00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,695
Unfortunately, I had
to pay a terrible price
on listening to her.
Ooh.

00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,730
So we have the same offer,
essentially, on the table.

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,931
Without a contingency,
in my case.

00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,634
But I think my contingency's
a good one.

00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,735
I don't think so.
Why take risks?

00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,869
Why take risks?
It's only gonna help you.

00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,738
It's only gonna help you.
So I guess my question is,

00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,573
Kevin, do you have experience
with manufacturing?

00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,241
‐Yes.
‐Kevin does not.

00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:43,875
Yes, I do!

00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,811
Okay, so you know I've done
over 600 products.

00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,046
We <i>all</i>
manufacture overseas.

00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,715
I would say
35% of my portfolio ‐‐
Do you know who has

00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,650
the number‐one
electronic‐component product

00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,784
out of "Shark Tank"
right now?

00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:53,986
It's called IllumiBowl,
it's manufactured in China.

00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,587
Oh, my God.
He's so ridiculous.

00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,689
Number two,
I make more Christmas lights

00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:58,824
than anybody else
in China.

00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,960
Kevin, are you willing
to go down back to 15%?

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,629
No way.
If you're willing to go back,
I'll make a deal now.

00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:05,998
[ Scoffs ] Kevin.

00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,733
Why didn't you take the deal
when you had it?

00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,134
Because, you know, I wanted ‐‐
I wanted to hear Lori out.

00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,036
O'Leary: I work with a lot
of entrepreneurs.
Yeah.

00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,071
You've got to bond right away.
Bird‐in‐hand theory.

00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,807
I think you have
to make a decision
between the two of us.

00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,743
Kevin,
I'm willing to go with you

00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,345
if you can drop down
to 20%.

I'm out.

00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,419
‐Oh.
‐Lesson learned.

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,023
All right. Well, I, you know,
very much appreciate it,

00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,859
but for the vision that I want
to create for this company,

00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,761
I know it's gonna require
additional capital.

00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,996
And so to get there,
it just doesn't make sense to me

00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,898
right now
from a valuation standpoint.

00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,833
Good for you, Ryan.
That's an expensive
walk down the hallway.

00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,502
Ryan, the lesson here
is when you get an offer

00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,670
that you're willing to take,
take it.

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,506
You didn't close.
‐Thank you.

00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,507
Hey, appreciate it.

00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,541
Thank y'all so much
for your time.

00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,809
Good luck.

00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,780
If I could turn back the clock,
I would have accepted his deal,

00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,115
but, you know, I can't do that,
and he stuck with it.

00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:00,619
You know, I respect that,
and, you know, lesson learned.

00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,888
Well, you taught that young man
a valuable lesson.

How many times have you

00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,666
traveled to a city

You get into the city
at 8:00 A. M.,

00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,636
and you have a meeting
at 1:00 P. M.

00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,772
What do you do
with those hours in between?

00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,708
There is a massive gap

You arrive early at your hotel,
you check in early,

00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,758

you order some room service,

Why?

Most hotel‐property‐management
systems

00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,159
cannot handle
a day‐room booking.

‐It does not work like that.
‐Let me ask you a question.

00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,597
But they charge late‐check‐in
rates all the time,

00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,532
unless you're able
to negotiate out of it.

00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,867
Let's use a chain name ‐‐
a Marriott ‐‐

I say, "Look, I'm not
checking in until 4:00."

00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,971
"I'm sorry, there's
an extra $80 charge there."

00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,840
You just mentioned that
there's an analogue process ‐‐

with your own
outside technology?

00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:43,949
Dass:
We're actually connecting

00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,518
to what is called
a channel‐management system

00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,786
that actually connects

00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,154
to the availability, rates,
and inventory.

00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,691
So there is a way that we're
connecting to get the rates

00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,727
to be able to set the rates up
to the half‐a‐day room.

or override or bypass

00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,486
their internal

Let me tell you.

00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,056
We are taking a fraction
of their inventory

00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,659
that is sitting empty
between 9:00 and 6:00,

00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,194
and we are selling it
to the customers.

Yes, it's technology ‐‐

I'll tell you why ‐‐

00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,672
because we're connecting
to a channel manager.

00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,007
So instead of going
through the CRS,

00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,808
we're connecting
to a channel manager,

00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,010
going straight
into the hotel.

00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,646

we are provisionally patented.

How many customers do you have?

Et cetera, et cetera?

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,435
We are at 6,500 bookings.

00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,103
All of the year of 2015,

00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:18,643
we generated about $127,000
in gross booking revenue,

00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,845
of which we're taking 14%,
all right?

00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,647
That's all?
That's our cut, yes.

00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:23,715

Wow.

00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,550

But it's reasonable.

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,718
It's a starting point.

with big hotel chains?
Yes.

00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,390

brand out there individually ‐‐

they cannot connect right now.

00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,602
They will not
waste their time.

00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,970

What you're doing is

00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,842
you're selling
somebody else's product,

that there's a lot of doubt
on this side of the room.

00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,829
First of all, the hotel
can't sell day rooms.

00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,931
They have not created
a system behind it.

00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,567
And two, the technology
and the protocol,

00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,568
they are missing.

00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:17,769
It takes time,
it takes investment.

00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,572
Guys, I do think it's a problem
you're trying to solve.

00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,073
That said, every time
I tried to ask you

00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:26,344
what technological, defensible,

00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,011

I couldn't get a straight answer
back from you guys.

00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,584
I don't actually think
there is something there.

But, sure, go ahead.

00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:38,990
We've had conversations
at the majors.

00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,825
They think it's really
interesting what ‐‐

00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,993
They think it's
really interesting,

00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,762
but those conversations
haven't ended up in a sale

00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:44,929
'cause you don't have
anything to buy.

00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,998
Your competition isn't
the big hotel chains.

00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,734
It's the software layer that
already rides on top of that.

00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:50,902
If you came in here
and told me

00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,971
you were reinventing
the entire management system

00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,807
the way OpenTable reinvented
the booking platform

00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,709
for a restaurant,
I'd be interested,

00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,843
but you're not.

00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,645
The quickest way to double
your money in this deal

00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,281
is to fold it over,
put it in your back pocket.

00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,650
I'm out.

00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,651

00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,854
Just so you know,

00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,725
up to last May,
we've generated $300,000,

00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,928
so the model is accelerating
20% month‐to‐month growth.

00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,464
Yeah, because you're working
with tiny numbers, though ‐‐

00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:19,998
that's why.

00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,667
The challenge is
how big can it be.

00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,935

she starts
a brand‐new app,

code is just

that tells a computer
what to do.

So, if we actually look
at the code that she's typed,

you can see line one
tells the computer

00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,130
to fill the screen
with an image of a shark tank.

00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,034
Line two tells it to stamp an
image of a shark on the screen,

when somebody taps that shark,

to make the shark pop."
