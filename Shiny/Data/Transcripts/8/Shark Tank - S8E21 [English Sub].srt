for your actual disarm PIN,

Every time you sell

you give me $5 back

like 35,000 are gone.

that you love.

00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:20,605
What if I told you your favorite
shops, bars, and restaurants

00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:21,872
would cover your ride?

00:22:21,872 --> 00:22:25,810
Introducing Validated, the app
that lets you earn free parking

00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,679
and free rides
when you shop and dine.

00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,781
Think of it like free shipping
for yourself.

00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:32,883
We'll discover the businesses
around you

00:22:32,883 --> 00:22:35,086
that will help cover
your transportation costs

00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:37,088
in exchange for being
their customer.

00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:39,857
Just tap a business to see
what's required to qualify

00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:41,826
and how much
they'll validate.

00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,928
Once you've spent
the required amount,

00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:47,798
simply slide and scan
to unlock validation credits.

00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:51,602
Stack credits from multiple
shops and restaurants,

00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:52,770
and then redeem them

00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,773
to your preferred mode
of transportation.

00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:58,976
It's a win‐win proposition that
makes getting around less a drag

00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:00,978
and boosts businesses'
bottom line.

00:23:00,978 --> 00:23:06,684
So, Sharks, which of you
is ready to get Validated?

00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:08,853
It's interesting
because it gets people

00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:10,955
back into
brick‐and‐mortar easier.

00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:12,657
Yeah, and th‐‐ and
that's exactly what we're ‐‐

00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,792
what we're seeing, Lori,
is that businesses

00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:15,993
are doing anything
that they can

00:23:15,993 --> 00:23:18,062
to get foot traffic
back in the stores per customer.

00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:19,263
W‐W‐Wait. Bar‐‐
Let me ask you
a simple question,

00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:20,798
because I ‐‐
I really don't get it.
Arnerson: Yeah?

00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:23,100
When I shop and I get
a dress for $200,

00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,137
they will give me,
basically, free parking?

00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:28,139
They will give you
credits based on that spend.

00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:30,574
But would it be enough
for me to park my car

00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:31,742
and shop for three hours?

00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:33,044
Totally depends
on the merchant.

00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,646
So, we let the merchants
set their own offers

00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:36,847
and their own spending
thresholds.

00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:39,116
But even that vagueness, I would
think, from the consumer view,

00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:42,186
uh, would be confusing
and not that motivational.

00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:44,922
The exciting thing about it is
that you can stack up as you go.

00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:46,857
So, let's say you're gonna go
out on ‐‐ on the town,

00:23:46,857 --> 00:23:48,092
you're gonna buy
a pair of shoes,

00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:50,127
you're gonna go have lunch,
you're gonna hit a movie.

00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:53,664
You can validate as you go, and
as you stack those credits up

00:23:53,664 --> 00:23:54,765
you can easily pay
for your whole trip.

00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:55,866
Sacca:
Give us some numbers.

00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:57,635
Give us some sense of success
or failure so far.

00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:59,003
So, right now we have
50 merchants

00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:01,072
in our launch cities
of Seattle and Portland.

00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:04,842
Right now, we're averaging
about 25 validations

00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:06,644
per merchant
across those 50.

00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:07,912
And so, the numbers are low.
We're early.

00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:09,814
How early? How long has
this been in business?

00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:11,115
So, we started
this last July.

00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:13,751
We kind of pivoted
from something else
into this business.

00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:16,087
Uh, by last fall, we had
a minimum viable product,

00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,089
and we've been rolling
this thing out.

00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,890
Tech question for you guys ‐‐
what were you scanning?

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,059
We were scanning a QR code
that's essentially

00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:24,795
a benign token
that is currently ‐‐
Right, but where is that?

00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:25,930
What ‐‐ It looked somebody
was holding something?

00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,665
Yeah, exactly.
So, essentially

00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:29,734
you would walk up to the
merchant at the cash out

00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,035
and would ask,
"Can I get validated?"

00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:32,737
The merchant has it behind
the counter and shows it.

00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:33,871
Okay, so the merchant
has their code...

00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:35,039
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
... and you just scan it.

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,041
So, what would you estimate
the value of a point to be?

00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,843
So, what we ‐‐
Sacca: No, to be clear ‐‐

00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:39,944
So it's one‐to‐one
per dollars.

00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:41,045
Wait. Wait.
Okay, can we just get rid of ‐‐

00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:42,246
You're not parking your car.
It's equal to a dollar?

00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:44,081
This is ‐‐ This is to get you
a ride to and from, right?

00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:45,850
So it's really like one credit
is one dollar.
One credit, one dollar?

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,985
Uh, you can ‐‐ you can push
validation credits for parking.

00:24:47,985 --> 00:24:49,887
So, we're gonna be partnering
with PayByPhone,

00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:51,021
which has 12 million users.

00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:52,690
They're a parking‐payment
processing app.

00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,891
It doesn't need
to be that complicated.

00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:56,127
Look, Uber works 'cause
it's push a button, get a ride.

00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:59,163
Your whole model should be "Buy
some stuff, get a ride," period.

00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:01,098
Like, not "Park your car,"
and not, like,

00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:02,733
"Hey, you can buy
some of the stuff here,

00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:03,934
and some of the stuff there,
and split your car

00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:06,036
parked on this level and
that level and buy more time."

00:25:06,036 --> 00:25:09,073
The minute you say, "Use your
transportation mode of choice,"

00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:11,776
and I start seeing you integrate
public‐transportation systems

00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,744
and all that stuff,
you've just made your comp‐‐

00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:16,680
your product
so unnecessarily complex.

00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,815
Yeah, but they've got
bigger problems, right,

00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:20,618
because you have to be the bank
for the points.

00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:21,852
We are the bank, yes.

00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:24,722
And you have to convince people
that the currency is valuable,

00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:25,956
so you're also
the Federal Reserve.

00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:27,024
That's a nightmare.
Right?

00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:30,027
Chris suggests Uber,
but that's a limited option.

00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:31,762
[ Laughs ] Yeah.
Not everybody uses Uber.

00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:32,930
No one's ever called 85%
of the market

00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,931
a "limited option."
Well, no, no, but it's still

00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:34,932
not ‐‐ not everybody's
gonna use it.

00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:36,066
You just drove to the mall.

00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:37,802
Chances are you didn't drive
to the mall in an Uber.

00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,170
Well, the chances
are extremely high

00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,838
you just went to the mall
in an Uber, actually.

00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:43,107
Right, that's why parking lots
are empty.

00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,944
Yes, Uber, Lyft ‐‐ they are kind
of the zeitgeist right now.

00:25:46,944 --> 00:25:48,612
Everybody wants to use it.

00:25:48,612 --> 00:25:50,681
But in
the transportation pie,

00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:53,150
if you look at it,
it's actually below 5%.

00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,052
Be honest ‐‐ when you start
slicing it to the people

00:25:55,052 --> 00:25:56,887
who have an iPhone,
who download apps,

00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:58,889
who are in the target market
for your advertisers,

00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:00,157
it's a huge, huge piece
of the pie.

00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:02,359
Definitely, definitely.
No doubt. Yes.
So we're not including,

00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,862
you know, Florida retirees
who go to the 4:00...
That's not the issue.
It doesn't even matter, right?

00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:06,063
It doesn't matter.
... early‐bird dinner.

00:26:06,063 --> 00:26:07,865
The point is
you're the bank.
Let's be honest here.

00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:09,900
You're a consumer bank
and you're the Federal Reserve,

00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,903
which complicates things
to an extreme.

00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:15,539
You have so many
integration points

00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,775
with all the different
participants.

00:26:17,775 --> 00:26:20,744
It's burdensome, and there's
gonna be ongoing bugs forever.

00:26:20,744 --> 00:26:21,979
That makes it more expensive.
The ‐‐ The ‐‐

00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:24,381
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:25,483
Okay.

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,856
You know, this sounds
so complicated.

00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,824
Maybe I'm missing
the point here.

00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:34,859
It's ‐‐ It's n‐‐

00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,861
I'm not even sure
there's a need for it.

00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,095
I'm definitely out.

00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:40,698
Okay. So, let me just address
Barbara's point.

00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:41,966
So, the reason that
there's a need for it

00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:45,903
is because retailers are seeing
everyone move to online, right?

00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:48,839
And so when you buy a product
in e‐commerce,

00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:52,009
what happens is 33%
of the time that product

00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:54,879
is shipped back, and there's
this endless volley, right?

00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,014
And so, what the
brick‐and‐mortar retailer

00:26:57,014 --> 00:26:59,717
want to do is they want
to get people in the store.

00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:02,586
I hate this.

00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:03,854
This is going
to zero for sure.

00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:05,856
You said you pivoted
into <i>this</i> nightmare.

00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,825
Pivot the...
the beep out of it.

00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:10,327
This is a dog.

00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:11,362
I'm out.

00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:12,930
Thank you.

00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,998
You know,
I see some merit.

00:27:13,998 --> 00:27:15,733
I could see restaurants
really loving it.

00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:17,034
I'm not sure, though,

00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:19,703
how many people
are gonna be using the app,

00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:22,640
and for that reason,
I'm out.

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,475
Thank you, Lori.
Thank you.

00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:30,114
I initially saw the tag line
in the first couple of screens,

00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:31,882
and I'm like,
"That is smart".
Mm‐hmm.

00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:34,718
"These guys are
driving traffic

00:27:34,718 --> 00:27:36,220
on a deal‐discovery basis."

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,356
And then with each additional
slide, you lost me.

00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:41,992
It's complicated.
There's choices.
The user experience sucks.

00:27:41,992 --> 00:27:44,895
"We're gonna try and accommodate
your car and your parking

00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:45,930
in this level
and that level,"

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,932
and then you show me
the QR code.

00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:51,669
QR codes are the herpes
of mobile technology.

00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,637
It should be as simple as

00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:55,773
"Buy some stuff, get a ride,"
period.

00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:58,409
Look, I don't believe
you're gonna make it.

00:27:58,409 --> 00:27:59,343
I'm out.

00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:04,815
Thank you.
Good luck, guys.

00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:06,784
Please,
light the QR codes on fire.

00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,985
Yeah, you don't want
to be a bank.

00:28:07,985 --> 00:28:09,587
You want to be
a connection.

00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,388
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:17,027
Tov: The way that we understand
our business,

00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:18,963
the way that we understand
our customers

00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,865
is far beyond, uh,
what they understand...
Mm‐hmm.

00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:23,767
...and I think it's been so long
that they worried

00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:24,935
about paying
for transportation,

00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:26,804
they don't understand,
like, what a pain point it is

00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:28,305
for the rest of us.

00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,414
♪♪

00:28:37,414 --> 00:28:38,715
I'm Brian.
And I'm Kyle.

00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:40,617
And our business is
Guardian Bikes.

00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:41,852
I first came up
with the idea

00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:43,787
seven years ago
when I was in college.

00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:46,490
My grandfather got in a really
serious bike accident

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,925
and broke several vertebrae
in his neck.

00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:50,594
He fully recovered
after a couple years,

00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:53,597
but it was a traumatic
experience for me and my family.

00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:54,832
That work?
Nice.

00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:56,633
There's a lot of
other technologies out there

00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:57,835
where when you get
in an accident,

00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:59,670

Similar to antilock brakes

of incorrect braking.

On a traditional bike,
if a child brakes too hard

or pulls the wrong brake lever
at the wrong time,

00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:47,911
the front wheel can
stop too soon,

SureStop uses just
one lever

00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:57,588
and always actives
the rear brake first,

00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:59,890
and then intelligently
adds in the front brake,

00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,594
eliminating the chance of ever
going over the handlebars.

00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:06,563
