00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:03,836
Narrator: These are the Sharks.

00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:06,806
They have achieved incredible
success as entrepreneurs

00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:10,443
and investors
in multiple sectors.

00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,445
They all came
from humble beginnings

00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:13,846
and are all self‐made.

00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:17,483
The Sharks know what it takes
to build business empires

00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,952
from nothing into billions.

00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:24,290
Now they are investing
in entrepreneurs' dreams.

00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,425
Sharks, this sucks.
Ew!

00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:28,361
You've created
an armpit diaper.

00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,428
If you boil it down.

00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:30,529
Wait for it.

00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:32,565
Wait for it.
Both: Boom!

00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:33,766
They went to Harvard
Business School?

00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:36,202
Narrator: This is the art
of doing business.

00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,203
And your sales are...?

00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,471
I have sold 200.

00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:39,505
Oh.

00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:41,374
Narrator:
This is "Shark Tank."

00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,541
We want to have
a positive impact

00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,576
on the people
of Afghanistan.

00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,378
You're not
in Afghanistan.

00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,545
You're in
the Shark Tank now.

00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:48,714
You have to know
your numbers.

00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:58,624
Narrator: First into the Tank
is a solution

00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,093
to an embarrassing problem.

00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,298
Our first victims.

[ Chuckles ]

00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,270
Hello, Sharks.
My name's Billy Thompson.

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,405
Hi. I'm Randy Choi.

00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,572
We're from Orange County,
California,

00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:15,474
and our company
is the Thompson Tee.

00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:19,345
We're seeking $700,000 in
exchange for 7% of our business.

00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,347
[ Laughter ]
Oh, God!

00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:24,050
Sharks,
this sucks.

00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,817
Ew!

00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:26,619
This doesn't suck.
[ Chuckles ]

00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,621
Even one of you Sharks
have experienced

00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,157
this sucky situation.

00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,492
[ Laughter ]
Aah!

00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:35,361
John: Oh, that is nasty.

00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,529
No, take it down!

00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,596
Take it down!

00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:39,432
Robert,
give these guys 700 grand.

00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,533
[ Laughter ]

00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,435
Thompson: Sharks, that's why
we invented a solution

00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,603
to this embarrassing,
age‐old problem ‐‐

00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:48,607
an undershirt that completely
blocks underarm sweat.

00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:49,775
Choi: It's called
the Thompson Tee,

00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:52,378
with Hydro‐Shield
sweatproof technology.

00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,713
All of our
"raise your hand,

00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,614
don't let them
see you sweat" shirts

00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:59,485
come with an unconditional,
30‐day, sweatproof guarantee.

00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:01,420
Wear it,
wash it, dry it.

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,855
Sweat‐free in more ways
than one.

00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:06,726
Proudly, our shirts were
handcrafted here in the U. S. A.

00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,995
So, which one of you Sharks
want to help us

00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,931
get rid of this sucky situation
once and for all?

00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:15,001
We brought a Thompson Tee
for each one of you.

00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,202
Cool.

00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:19,372
Thank you.
Yeah.

00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,540
Greiner: Thank you.
Yeah.

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,575
John: Thank you.

00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,177
Cuban: Thank you, sir.
Yeah.

00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:25,711
Cute.

00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,747
So, Randy,
wear an undershirt

00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,549
underneath a great shirt
like this,

00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,418
it will stop you
from sweating,

00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,487
and it'll protect
the outer garment.

00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,554
Correct.
Correct.

00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:37,490
What's the difference
between the one

00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,859
I'm wearing right now
and yours?

00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,694
Well,
look in the armpit.
Yeah,
look at the armpit.

00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,429
This is,
like, triple‐layered.

00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,497
No.
No, no, no.

00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,532
They have a Kotex
underneath the armpit.

00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:48,601
[ Laughter ]
That's the difference.

00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,736
But you're just
a basic undershirt

00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,338
with padding.
Correct.

00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,440
It fees like,
in the entire underarm,

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,674
you've reinforced...
It feels like a...

00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,810
...and put, like,
three layers of fabric.

00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,645
What you had to do is,
you can't just slap

00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:01,614
a waterproof material
against your skin.

00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,516
It'll actually
exacerbate the problem.

00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,618
So we had to come out
with a way to mitigate

00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,752
that thermal heat
transfer.

00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:09,188
But it's just three layers
of cotton, right?

00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,489
No, that's incorrect.

00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,526
Inside, the inner layer
is an ultra‐thin,

00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,795
four‐way stretch,
compound polymer,

00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,696
medical‐grade film
that allows

00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:19,231
vapor to pass through...
Oh, really?

00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:19,799
...but will block moisture.

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,467
So there is something
proprietary in this?

00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,569
Absolutely. We do have
a patent on the product.

00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,704
So, you've created
an armpit diaper

00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:27,606
for people that really sweat
profusely.

00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:28,908
Basically.
Pretty much, yeah.

00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,709
If you boil it down,
correct.
So, Billy,
it's three layers ‐‐

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:31,710
Now ‐‐ Now,
before you tell us

00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,778
the sales, because...
Yes.

00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:34,580
...a really crazy number here,
but, you know,

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,315
I like to get, like ‐‐
You know, I'm romantic.

00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:37,583
Don't go into
valuation yet.

00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,951
Like, you got
to hear the story.
I want to hear the story.

00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,786
Randy, tell us the story.
Now tell us the story.

00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:42,788
Yeah.
Well, I mean,
it goes way back.

00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:45,391
I mean, I was in 7th grade,
and I pitted out.

00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,459
That's way back, man.
Yeah.

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,260
I'd prefer you started
in grade 1.

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,663
[ Laughter ]

00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,698
Well...
7th grade mattered,
because that's when...

00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:54,767
Maybe in the womb.
Puberty ‐‐
That's when it happens.

00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,368
So, I reached out
to Randy.

00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:57,703
Randy and I
were kind of mutual friends.

00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,405
I knew he was in
the apparel business.

00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,639
I grew up
in the apparel industry.

00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,842
And it turned out
that he actually had

00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,411
a form of hyperhidrosis,
which, by the way,

00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,813
is the clinical term
for excessive sweat.

00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:09,548
He knew exactly
what I was doing,

00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:10,783
and he became passionate
about it,

00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,486
'cause he understood,
and he partnered with me.

00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,521
What percentage of people
have that problem?

00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,989
1.5% have this problem,

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:20,593
and then another 35% deal with
it on a situational basis.

00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,394
Randy,
agree with me on this.

00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:23,429
Yes.

00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,798
99% of the guys,

00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,733
if they simply wore
an undershirt,

00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:30,102
it would get rid of
some of the sweat.

00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:32,738
It will definitely get rid
of some of the sweat.
Some. Some.

00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,240
Correct.
Well,
here's a good example ‐‐

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,773
you,
in that picture.

00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:36,675
You say
you always wear one.

00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:39,145
But I was doing
incredible exercise.

00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:39,812
[ Laughter ]

00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:43,449
Or is this for people
with a serious sweat problem?

00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,484
It's for the 35%
of the population

00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:47,453
that's buying clinical‐strength
antiperspirant

00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,588
for those situational meetings,
weddings,

00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:52,424
first dates, job interviews,
and this stuff

00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:53,425
is not working
for them.

00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:54,460
How much does it cost?

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,628
It comes in two different ‐‐
two different lines.

00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,862
We have the original fit,
which fits

00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,597
like a traditional undershirt,
and then we have the slim fit,

00:04:58,597 --> 00:04:59,665
which fits more
to the contours of the body.

00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,535
Right. How much?
Original fit is $24.99.

00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:06,272
The bamboo line
is $29.99.

00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,006
What's your cost
to make them?

00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,575
We average about $8.50.
Herjavec:
How do you sell them?

00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,744
We sell everything
direct to consumer,

00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,446
online, at our website
and then also on Amazon.

00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:15,581
And your sales are...?

00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,550
On year 1,
we did $90,000.

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,552
Year 2, we did
half a million dollars.

00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,886
Year 3,
we did $1 million.

00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:23,522
And year 4,
we did $2 million.
Wow.

00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:24,757
Year‐to‐date,
we are at $2.6 million,

00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,525
on pace
to do $4 million.

00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,727
What are you making
on the $2.6 million?
25%.

00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,729
I'm surprised.
You're not crazy, then.

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:31,897
Whoa. Wait a second.
Thompson: Thank you.

00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:34,633
Thank you.
You want a $10 million
valuation.

00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:39,638
Who's paying more
than 10 times for T‐shirts?

00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:41,340
Good question.
Patented T‐shirts.

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,408
Yes.

00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,676
But, guys, the technology ‐‐

00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,611
"technology" ‐‐
is fine, right?

00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,645
It serves the purpose.

00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:48,347
But you're really
a marketing company.

00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,682
Yeah.

00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,883
That's what you are,
right?

00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,620
Because you found a niche,
however big it is,

00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,456
and you figured out
how to digitally market,

00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:58,591
retain your margin,
and you continue

00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,359
to grow your
customer base.

00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,527
And you're killing it.

00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,761
So, the main question becomes ‐‐
you're making money,

00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:06,432
you got expertise in
manufacturing and in sales ‐‐

00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,666
what are you here for?

00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,668
Well, we'd like
the capital to bring

00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:10,903
our production
in‐house.

00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,506
How much would you lower your
cost if you brought it in‐house?

00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:16,542
We estimate about
$2 to $2.50.

00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,644
Why do you want to take
that time

00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,779
to then take on
the manufacturing?

00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,014
Because then you're
gonna lose time

00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,749
doing what you're doing best ‐‐
getting out to the customer.

00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:24,817
Cuban: 'Cause then you're gonna
go through the ‐‐

00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:25,818
you're gonna go through
that learning curve,

00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,787
and just managing
all those people

00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:30,456
and dealing with those hassles
that come with it.

I don't have a problem

with you wanting
to bring it in.

00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,662
I get it. $2 on an $8 item ‐‐
that's a huge margin.
Right.

00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,796
Here's my only disconnect.

00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:39,698
Not to be a Kevin,
but you're asking

00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:44,436
for 2 1/2 times your revenue
as a valuation.

00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:47,606
How do you get to
a $10 million value today?

00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:50,676
Because of the ‐‐
the size of the market,

00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,646
the historical growth,
the lack of alternatives.

00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,648
But the truth is,
you can spin the story

00:06:55,648 --> 00:07:00,352

I normally would say that you're
crazy about the valuation here,

for asking for that amount.

But my biggest challenge...

that whole process

to be in that space.

that path with you, so I'm out.

00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,819
Guys, one of the challenges
sometimes for entrepreneurs

00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:36,555
is knowing what business
they're truly in.

00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,624
The reality is
you're a marketing company.

00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,427
If you would've come here
and said, "$700K,

00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,430
we're getting 2x
on every dollar we spend,

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,699
and so we think, with $700K,
we can increase that

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,369
and go to the next level and get
3x on every dollar we spend,"

00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,403
that would've
been different.

00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:52,504
That would've been
an acknowledgement ‐‐

00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:54,406

a great marketing company."

that most guys don't know,
not only for the sweat,

look better, cleaner.

Nope.

Hello, Sharks.
My name is Trevor Johnston.

The belt buckle ‐‐
the Wallet Buckle

00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,410

The Wallet Buckle
will allow you to carry

00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,437
up to five cards safely
and securely

00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:40,806
right inside
your belt buckle.

00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,476
But even if you have one card,
they are all tension‐held,

00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,577
so they're
not gonna fall out.

00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,513
So even if you have one card,
just slides right in...

just because they're
already selling belt straps,

00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,515
so you can actually mix
and match your belt straps.

"Why hasn't anybody
thought of this?"

Well, when I said we're taking
the nation by storm, I meant it.

So, we just started selling ‐‐

00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,769
The very first event
was at Stagecoach,

00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:47,339
which is a big country‐music
festival right out here

00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,341
in Southern California,
last year.

00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,876
So it's been
about 18 months, so ‐‐

00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,179
and we've sold upwards of
about 15,000 units.

00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,414

them for at ‐‐ at ‐‐

00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:57,616
Between $40 and $95.

00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,452
15,000 units last year.
What are the total sales?

00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,553
No, not last year.

00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:05,724
Last year,
we did only $250,000 in sales.

00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,692
This year, to date,
we're already over $500,000

00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:10,428
and projecting close to $800,000
by the end of the year.

00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:11,563
It sounds good.
So let's go through one.

00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,798
What's the average cost
of a buckle?

00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:15,901
What does it cost you to make,
and what do you sell them for?

00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:20,705
So, any of just the colored ones
right here are $49.95.

00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,741
All right, so let's take
one of those, $49.

00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,542
What does it
cost you to make?

00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,712
Currently, about $7
but it can be as low as $5.

00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:29,347
What's the breakdown
of sales?

Where have you
been selling them?

00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,752
About 80% of the sales
are done in live events,

00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,488
and when I say "live events,"
it's festivals,

00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,790
it's concerts,
rodeos.

can we go through next year's

00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:43,361
optimistic sales scenario?

as good as it can get,

00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:49,267
what revenues are gonna be

00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,235
Absolutely.

00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:55,607
Well, just give me a number.
I don't need the adjectives.

00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,908
I think we're gonna
be $2.5 million, $3 million.

Let's make it $3 million.
Yeah, what would
your margin be on that?

about that retailer.

Who was it?

I've never heard
of Buckle.

00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,915
So what kind of store is this,
and what do they sell?

00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:06,284
They sell, I believe,
two out of every three pair

Is that the buckle

made, actually...
'Cause it attracts a lot of
attention and questions?

O'Leary: When you display
the buckle in Buckles,

00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,813
how does anybody know
that it stores credit cards?

00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:37,382
So, we opened our first kiosk
in the mall

00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,650
to get Buckle's
attention.

00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,085
So, I moved out to Nashville
three months ago,

00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,521
and I told the mall in there ‐‐
I did, really. There it is.

00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:46,391
And so I literally moved out
to Nashville,

00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,759
and I told the mall,
"I want my kiosk

00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,527
to be right
in front of Buckle.

00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:51,496
Do you have to pay
to put that kiosk in?

00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:53,431
$67 a day.

00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:54,833
$67 a day.
So you have
this in malls.

00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,302

Great year's $3 million
in sales.

00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:09,481
You're gonna make $450,000
pre‐tax, $300,000 after tax.

00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,383
You're telling me
this business is worth

00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:16,421
$5 million
or about 16 times

00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,889
what you're gonna make
in a good year.

00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:21,292
You think that's a little
aggressive for a belt buckle?

00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:21,893
You'd think so.

00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:24,529
We have about $1 million
of inventory already.

00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:25,864
Why do you have $1 million
of inventory?

00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,866
We'll blow through that.
We're ready to go.
We're ready to go.

00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,868
We've done events where we'll do
30 Gs in three days.

00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,770
Yeah, but between those days,
you have to travel,

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,571
you have to set up,
there's a cost.

00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:35,240
So that's $200,000,
at cost.

00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:31,963
80% of your sales right now
are going through live events,

00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:34,532
and that means that you guys
are the salespeople.

00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:35,700
I mean,
the schtick is funny.

00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,569
I'm ready to buy one now
just because

00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,636
we fall in love with you.

00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:40,638
But when you sell now
to kiosks, number one ‐‐

00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:42,874
and those are your kiosks? ‐‐
all that inventory's yours.

00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,310
It's always on the books.
It never comes off the books.

00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,678
When you sell to retailers,

00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,513
nobody can tell
what that buckle is.

00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,515
And the reason I know this
is because I have a company

00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,750
named Mission Belt,
and I also have a company,

00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,720
Myself Belts, and unless
the salesperson is wearing it

00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,790
and they're obsessed with it,
they don't sell.

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,692
And that's
the biggest challenge.

00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,627
So you have a good business
for yourself.

00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:06,397
$5 million valuation's
absolutely crazy.

00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:07,432
I can't help you
with this.

00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,067
I'm out.

00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:11,836
Guys, look,
I live in Dallas, right?

00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:14,806
And in Texas, big belt buckles
are not unusual.

00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,674
It's not that
there's not a market.

00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:20,378
It's just, I don't think
it's a big enough market for ‐‐

00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:22,547
for what you're trying to do.

00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,582
Designing belt buckles
to turn this

00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:30,321
into a $50 million company ‐‐
That's gonna be hard.

00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:32,123
I'm out.

00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,526
And then
there was one.

00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,462
Yeah.
So, my concern is

00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,696
men wear belts a lot.

00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:39,864
They wear pants a lot.

00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:42,700
A lot of women are changing up
from dresses,

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,569
skirts, pants ‐‐
you know, everything ‐‐

00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,405
and maybe don't wear belts
that often.

00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:49,641
So, while you're doing
a great business,

00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,244
but because I feel like
it's rather niche,

00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:55,079
I'm out.

00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,549
Hmm.

00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,616
Thank you, guys.

00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:00,952
Good luck, guys.
Congrats.

00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:05,557
Justin: They missed out
on a huge opportunity

00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,393
for a product that's
gonna go big and go viral.

00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,995
And people are fanatical
about it.

00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,506
Narrator: Next into the Tank
are veterans

00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,708
hoping to help farmers
in a war‐torn country

00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,544
by capitalizing
on a rare commodity.

00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:30,048
♪♪

00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,485
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Kim.

00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:35,753
I'm Emily.
And I'm Keith.

00:22:35,753 --> 00:22:39,457
We're from Chicago, Illinois,
and we are Rumi Spice.

00:22:39,457 --> 00:22:42,627
Sharks, today,
we are seeking $250,000

00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,863
in investment in exchange
for 5% of our company.

00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:49,467
What do you think about when you
hear the word "Afghanistan"?

00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:52,770
Perhaps war,
terrorism, opium.

00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,306
Those are the reasons
we went to Afghanistan

00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:56,608
as U. S. Army soldiers.

00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,510
I supported Special Operations
on night raids.

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,446
I was a Route Clearance
platoon leader,

00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,448
looking for roadside bombs.

00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,316
And I was an Afghan
regional expert,

00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:06,517
working
with tribal elders.

00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:08,386
While we were deployed,

00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:11,689
we saw a very different
Afghanistan.

00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:14,726
Afghanistan is a land inhabited
by proud people

00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,861
with a rich culture
and history ‐‐

00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:21,599
and covered in fields
of violet‐colored flowers.

00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,502
In these precious
purple flowers

00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:26,537
lies the rarest
and most expensive

00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:28,940
spice in the world ‐‐
saffron.

00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,677
It's the queen of all spices
and worth its weight in gold.

00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,647
In modern‐day cooking,
there is not risotto Milanese

00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,616
or paella that is complete
without saffron.

00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:40,818
Sharks,
after 30 years of war,

00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:43,688
Afghanistan, once a progressive
and peaceful country,

00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,391
has been cut off from
the international marketplace.

00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,559
So, before returning home
from our deployment,

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,696
we wanted to figure out a way
to empower these Afghan farmers.

00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,632
So we built a business,
working directly with them,

00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:58,670
and we've now created a market
for premium Afghan saffron.

00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,605
Now only one
question remains ‐‐

00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,774
which one of you Sharks
will join our mission

00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,476
to cultivate peace
and harvest profits

00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:08,746
for yourselves and for
our farmers in Afghanistan?

00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:11,215
Today, we have prepared
something very special

00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:12,383
for you guys to try.

00:24:12,383 --> 00:24:14,118
We want to show‐‐
We always love that.

00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:15,787
[ Laughter ]

00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,656
So, we wanted to showcase
the versatility of saffron,

00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:20,525
because it's both in savory
and sweet applications.

00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,693
Herjavec: Thank you.
Mm‐hmm.

00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,861
So, our chef made
a saffron ghee,

00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:27,565
like a saffron butter, drizzled
with lemon zest over yogurt.

00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:30,835
And on the sweet side,
a saffron‐infused honey drop.

00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:34,439
And you guys also have
the Rumi saffron gift.

00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,740
There's 2 grams in there.

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,643
I know saffron
from paella.
Yep.

00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,778
But this almost
smells like tobacco.

00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:42,780
So, saffron you might've been
used to is saffron

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,782
that's maybe two,
three years old,

00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:47,585
and it's lost that sweet smell
of the saffron

00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:48,753
that comes fresh
from the harvest.

00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,621
And where do I get
saffron today

00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:52,690
if I don't get it
from Afghanistan?

00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,925
You can get it from Spain,

00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,994
although Spain exports a lot
more than it actually grows,

00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:59,764
so 90% of the world's saffron
actually comes from Iran.

00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,666
So when you're buying Spanish
saffron, more than likely,

00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,301
you're buying
low‐quality saffron

00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:03,868
that's changed
many hands.

00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:05,803
And Afghanistan saffron,
for three years running,

00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:08,606
has been named the best‐quality
saffron in the world.

00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:09,607
How do you trade it?

00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:11,709
What does it sell for per ‐‐
per what?

00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:15,646
So, on retail,
we sell 1 gram for $18,

00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:17,448
and then we also sell
in the restaurants,

00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:20,485
so we have it
at $140 per ounce.

00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,786
Okay. And why is it
so expensive?

00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,322
It's so expensive because
there's no automation.

00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,391
It all has to be
hand‐processed.

00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,326
It's insanely
labor‐intensive.

00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,795
It takes 150 hours
of labor

00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,797
just to produce 1 gram
of saffron.

00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:36,167
So, how much does
this bottle sell for, retail?

00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,602
$35...
Man.

00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,271
and it cost us $8.30
to make.

00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:40,805
Well,
let me ask you something.

00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,740
The pricing
that you have here,

00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,209
whether it's the valuation
or whether it's the product,

00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,511
is ‐‐ it's high,

00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,379
and that means it's
gonna be a limited market,

00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:50,415
and that means you may
or may not be able

00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,850
to help the people
that you're trying to help.

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,919
We're absolutely
a luxury brand, right?

00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,423
We are at the high end of the
market selling premium saffron.

00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,324
But what we do
with the money that we make

00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:01,759
is we reinvest
that profit

00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,761
back into the infrastructure
in Afghanistan.

00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:05,496
We are definitely in it
to make money.

00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:07,765
We are a for‐profit company,
but we really believe

00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:09,767
that making a difference
is also important

00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:11,502
and that we want to
have a positive impact

00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:13,404
on the people
of Afghanistan.

00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:14,439
O'Leary:
What are your sales?

00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,541
We've made $400,000
in sales so far.

00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:20,511
We've projected $750,000
this year.
Wow.

00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:23,681
So tell us about the sales
of saffron in the United States.

00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:25,983
In the United States,
it's a little over

00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:28,786
$60 million,
so it's not big.
Way bigger
than I thought.

00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:30,788
Well, how do you compare it
to another spice?

00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:32,857
The spice market is about,
I think,

00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:36,561
over $10 billion,
so it's a very small part of it,

00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,762
but it's
the highest‐grossing.

00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,697
We're not really
in the spice industry here.

00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:41,799
We're talking about building
a brand around saffron

00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,668
and doing other
saffron‐related products.

00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,570
So you want to turn
this into a brand.

00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,604
Mm‐hmm.
Right.

00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,639
One, how are you gonna
turn it into a brand,

00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:51,542
and, two, who's your primary
customer going to be?

00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:52,743
So, we want to reach
the end consumer,

00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:54,679
so through our partners
like Blue Apron,

00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,880
also through speciality
retailers ‐‐

00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,316
Well, Blue Apron, you're kind
of hidden in there, right?

00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,517
You're an OEM type ‐‐
No.

00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,385
It's our story,
it's our packaging.

00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:02,653
We're being featured
in their meals.

00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:04,755
So, we do want to be
in retail ‐‐ specialty retail.

00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:06,724
We have already worked
with Daniel Boulud,

00:27:06,724 --> 00:27:08,793
Chef de Cuisine,
to do a Rumi saffron butter.

00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,795
We have different spice blends
with saffron in them,

00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,797
and we're looking at things
like saffron tea.

00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,899
I mean, think about the size
of the tea market.

00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,667
What do you see as your biggest
political risk?

00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:17,869
I don't think there's
a political risk,

00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,604
because we're operating
with the farmers,

00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,305
we're giving them an incentive
to produce,

00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:21,906
and we're giving them
an incentive

00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,541
to protect
their investment.
Okay.

00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,676
Kim, how did you guys meet?
How did you guys meet?

00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:28,880
So, Kim and I met during
emergency operations

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,782
on Hurricane Sandy recovery
on Manhattan Island.

00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:33,584
And the way we started
this business,

00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:34,719
I was deployed
to Afghanistan

00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,521
in one of the most
dangerous provinces.

00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,822
And I met this farmer,
Haji Yosef,

00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,391
who was selling
this incredible, vibrant

00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:41,592
red spice
called saffron.

00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:43,561
At the time, I didn't know
anything about saffron.

00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,663
I did some research,
I found out Afghanistan

00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,399
grows the best‐quality
saffron in the world.

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,734
So I thought,
"Who's better to call

00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,937
who were at
Harvard Business School.
Hang on a sec.

00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,406
They went
to Harvard Business School?
That's correct.

00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:56,707
We went to West Point
together, too.

00:27:56,707 --> 00:27:59,677
Just small
accomplishments.

00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,512
Here's what
I think about it.

00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:02,880
First of all,
thank you for your service.

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,249
It's an honor.
I love what you're doing.

00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:05,883
I really do.

00:28:05,883 --> 00:28:08,753
As a PAGE ambassador
and all of us Sharks,

00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,789
we believe in entrepreneurship
and helping people,

00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:14,725
because if you're helping
all these people in Afghanistan,

00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:16,360
they're able to feed
their families

00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,328
with an honest day's living.

00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,663
So I love that.

00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,631
My biggest challenge is,

00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:22,400
the product is just
too expensive

00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,036
for the everyday person,
and for that reason,

00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,904
I'm out.

00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:30,508
Greiner:
So, I'm a huge foodie.

00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,310
I go crazy for truffle ‐‐

00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,411
truffle anything.
Miller: Yeah.

00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,912
Truffle.
Truffle oil,
truffle fries.

00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:37,648
Saffron, to me, feels like
the equivalent of a truffle...

00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:39,216
Exactly.
Exactly it.

00:28:39,216 --> 00:28:40,251
Greiner: ...in a spice.

00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,752
It's expensive,

00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:44,522
it's a premium,
and a luxury.

00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,524
I love you.
I love what you're doing.

00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:48,392
The statement's great.

00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:49,794
The problem for me is,

00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,563
I personally
don't like saffron,

00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:54,932
so I'm out.

00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:57,802
O'Leary: Can I just ask?

00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:01,505
Your forecast for this year is
to break even on the $750,000?

00:29:01,505 --> 00:29:02,640
Yes, break even.

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,009
But, actually, by next month,
we'll be profitable.

00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,712
And next year, you said you're
going to make $1.5 million.

00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,813
How much will you make
on that?

00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:12,617
I mean, I would estimate
probably 5% net income.

00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,485
5% pre‐tax?

00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:15,620
Herjavec:
But, Kim, why?

00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,356
Why is the margin so low
for such a high‐gross margin?

00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,557
Why is the net margin
so low?

00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,659
So, I just did
that from comps,

00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,527
from what I read
from other food and beverage,

00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:24,729
but this is, you know ‐‐

00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,398
this is ‐‐
this is a guess.

00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,433
I think we can actually
be a lot higher.

00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:30,668
And with your help,
we can be.

00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,537
I got to tell you, Kim,
for a couple of Harvard grads,

00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:35,373
I'm a little surprised
you don't have your model

00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,241
nailed down
a little more.

00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,744
They do.
No, they don't.

00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:40,878

let me ask you this.
No, they don't.

00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:42,913
Yes, we are Harvard grads,
but we're not perfect.

00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:44,749
I mean, I was just a Harvard
grad last year, all right?

00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,651
[ Laughs ]
Most of my education

00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,753
has been what we've been doing
this last year.

00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,422
You guys are the ones
who know the stuff.

00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,591
This is why we're here.

00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,660
We're bringing to the table
what we've done so far.

00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,495
Listen, I think
what you've done is great,

00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,729
and I also would say
that many of us

00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:00,564
love to invest
in people that have served,

00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:03,367
because the military provides
a certain discipline

00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,236
that applies well
to business.

00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,704
My problem with you

00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:09,874
is I don't think
you're worth $5 million.

00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,710
When I asked you how much money
you were gonna make

00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,446
on the $750,000,
the answer was zero.

00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,314
A multiple of zero
is still zero,

00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:19,617
so I can't value it
that way.

00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:22,653
So I have to ask myself,
"What have you built,

00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:24,755
to date,
that's worth 5 million bucks?"

00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:25,856
I don't see that.
A lot of what
we've built to date

00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:27,892
has been in the infrastructure
in Afghanistan.

00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,827
We're gonna hit profitability
in the next month,

00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:32,630
and that's when you're gonna see
our margins grow.

00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,532
We run a high‐margin business,
guys, and it's growing.

00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,766

Yes, we are.

You said
you were gonna make 5%.

on other food and beverage ‐‐

Our gross margins online are,
what ‐‐ 75% or 80%.

00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:49,513
So how isn't that translating
into 20%, pre‐tax?

00:30:49,513 --> 00:30:50,681
That's what I
don't understand.

00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:51,816
Okay.
So I will take that back ‐‐
I don't ‐‐

00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,651
You know where you lost me,
if you want to be honest?

00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,520
I loved your story,
but when you told me

00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,888
you thought you were
gonna make 5%,

I knew you knew nothing
about your numbers. Nothing.

00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,894
Well, at this point,
what do entrepreneurs focus on?

00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:06,630
They focus on gross margin,
and they focus on top line.

00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:56,793
a colander,
an egg separator.

00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:58,428
Sharks, this is a mess.

00:34:58,428 --> 00:34:59,629
You're doing dishes all night.

00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:00,764
I know what you're thinking,
Sharks.

00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:03,633
There's got to be a better way.
There is.

00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:04,968
All right, Sharks,
this is the Scooping Bowl.

00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:08,772
The Scooping Bowl will save you
time, space, and money.

00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:09,973
Let me show you
how it works, guys.

00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:12,676
We all love healthy
and delicious snacks.

00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:16,580
Take your favorite fruits and
vegetables, pop them in here.

00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,182
The blade holds the food back.

00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:24,688
We're soaking, we're washing,

00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:25,722
and we're straining, guys.

00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:29,626
Same bowl washes,
strains, soaks.

00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:30,794
[ Laughing ]
Wow.
Look at that.

00:35:30,794 --> 00:35:32,662
That's amazing!
I like this boy.

00:35:32,662 --> 00:35:33,663
Peoples:
You guys are loving this.

00:35:33,663 --> 00:35:35,432
Hold on. There's more.

00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:35,999
All right, guys,
look at this.

00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:39,069
The silicone blade
cleans it, nice and dry.

00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:41,905
Guess what, guys. I mentioned
an egg separator earlier.

00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:42,906
Let me show you
how that works.

00:35:42,906 --> 00:35:44,774
Instead of breaking out
two bowls,

00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:48,011
getting your hands dirty,
guys, check this out.

00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:51,848
The yolk stays back,
and the white slips through.

00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:53,517
Let's see.
Can you guys see that?

00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:54,784
Wow.
Wow.

00:35:54,784 --> 00:35:57,721
Let's make our favorite recipes,
right?

00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,624
This is perfect for pancakes,
waffles, brownies,

00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:02,792
cookies, birthday cake.

00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:05,629
In one smooth motion,

00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:06,830
the Scooping Bowl is gonna get

00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,534
all of your expensive
ingredients right out.

00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:11,935
Ahh.

00:36:11,935 --> 00:36:13,770
Sharks, once you feel this
in your hands,

00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,672
you're gonna get it,
and you're gonna love it.

00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:16,773
I have one
for each of you.

00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:18,975
Thank you.
[ Laughs ]
Wow.

00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:21,811
Thank you very much, Tyler.
I'm gonna give one to Lori.

00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:24,481
Thank you.
There you go, Lori.

00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:26,716
O'Leary:
Thank you very much.

00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:29,352
It's very cool.
I get blue.

00:36:29,352 --> 00:36:30,520
John: Thank you.

00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,955
Cuban: Thank you.

00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:33,957
Tell us about you.
I'll tell you about me.

00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:36,960
It's ‐‐
It's an unlikely story, guys.

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,929
When I was born,
the doctors told my mom,

00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:41,431
"It's unlikely he's gonna
survive more than two weeks..."

00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:41,998
Oh, wow.
Wow.

00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:43,900
"...and if he does survive,
it's unlikely

00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,636
he will ever gain his hearing,
and it's unlikely

00:36:46,636 --> 00:36:48,605
that he will ever speak."

00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:52,642
It's unlikely that a guy
with no culinary training,

00:36:52,642 --> 00:36:55,712
the son of a housekeeper,
would become the head chef

00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:56,947
at the best restaurant
in town.

00:36:56,947 --> 00:36:59,816
It's unlikely that a guy
with no business training

00:36:59,816 --> 00:37:02,752
would get a U. S. patent,
would find a manufacturer.

00:37:02,752 --> 00:37:04,988
It's unlikely, guys,
but it's true.

00:37:04,988 --> 00:37:08,692
And I want to invite you guys
to join this unlikely story.

00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:10,060
All right,
tell us your story.

00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,696
I worked at all sorts
of fancy restaurants,

00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:15,398
and I cooked for thousands
of people, fine dining.

00:37:15,398 --> 00:37:16,800
So I worked my way up.

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,370
I was the head chef
at a great restaurant in town.

00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:20,870
And you know what?

00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,773
I had in my heart
to do more,

00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:26,443
so I left my job,
and I went to work

00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:27,711
at the local rescue mission.

00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:29,813
So, what happened?
How did you think of this?

00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:31,715
I deal with bowls,
I deal with spatulas,

00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:33,984
I deal with all this stuff
many, many times a day.

00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:36,820
I struggle, it's annoying,
it's a mess, and I'm thinking,

00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,622
"There's got to be a better
way," and I'm waiting

00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:41,424
for somebody else
to make this dream real.

00:37:41,424 --> 00:37:42,859
And I was tired of waiting.

00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:44,794
Guys, I knew that if it was
gonna happen,

00:37:44,794 --> 00:37:45,895
I was gonna make it happen.

00:37:45,895 --> 00:37:46,997
Herjavec: So, Tyler...
Good for you, Tyler.

00:37:46,997 --> 00:37:49,599
Tyler, where are you
in the product cycle?

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,567
Mm‐hmm.
Is this a prototype?

00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:51,735
This is not a prototype.

00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:53,970
I found a manufacturer,
and I have a utility patent.

00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,640
What does it cost you to make,
and what do you sell it for?

00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,541
It costs $5.80.

00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,477
I sell it for $24.95.

00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:01,911
And have you sold
any of them?

00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:04,381
That's a great question.
Yes, I have sold.

00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:05,282
How many?
[ Laughs ]

00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:07,384
I've sold 200.

00:38:07,884 --> 00:38:10,887
So, I know that's not
a great number.

00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:13,556
Well, how have you done it?
Online?

00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:16,960
I've done it trade shows
and gadget expos.

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,797
This, I believe, sells best
when people see it.

00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:23,400
'Cause in a store, you wouldn't
know what this does.

00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:23,900
Right.

00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,703
Why would you leave
a great restaurant

00:38:26,703 --> 00:38:28,638
to go work
at a mission?

00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:29,973
Mm‐hmm.
Is there a personal ‐‐

00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:31,841
He has a higher goal.
He has a higher goal.

00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:34,911
I always knew I wanted to feed
people who were hungry

00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:37,080
and not just for food
but for opportunity.

00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,650
And I don't know how many
thousands of people I've fed.

00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,619
They weren't hungry.
They weren't.

00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:43,953
Greiner: Are you able
to live on that, though?

00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:46,022
What's helping you
to pay your rent?
I am.

00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:49,592
At that shelter,
we serve over 150,000 meals

00:38:49,592 --> 00:38:51,494
to the public,
so that's free of charge.

00:38:51,494 --> 00:38:52,562
But it has a cost.

00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:55,432
So, one way
to recoup the money

00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:56,800
is we run a catering business,

00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,769
and the catering business
employs men who have graduated

00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:02,472
our addiction‐recovery program.

00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:04,741
And I help
to fund the mission.

00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:05,809
Good for you.
Wow.

00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:07,844
Thank you.
Greiner:
Good for you.

00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:09,512
Well, listen, Tyler, I'm gonna
take a flier on you.

00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:10,980
I like you.
I think this is smart.

00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,750
It's a better mouse trap.
Cooks will respond to it.

00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,553
It's a great gadget
to have in the kitchen.

00:39:16,553 --> 00:39:17,620
So I'm gonna make you
an offer ‐‐

00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,990
$75,000 for 33 1/3% ‐‐
so that I will have

00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,793
a third of the business
and you will have the rest,

00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:26,596
and I will help you get this out
there into Bed Bath,

00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:27,664
QVC, and all of that.

00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:30,133
I think I can help you
get this everywhere.

00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,436
But you need
to say yes now.

00:39:42,712 --> 00:39:43,880
Narrator: All Sharks
are still in,

00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,915
and Tyler has an offer
from Lori for his

00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:49,519
multi‐use bowl company,
Peoples Design.

00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,887
I think I can help you
get this everywhere.

00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:54,391
But you need
to say yes now.

00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,794
Cuban: Well, I'll simplify it
real quick, right?

00:39:57,794 --> 00:39:59,729
My favorite utensil
in the kitchen is the phone

00:39:59,729 --> 00:40:03,700
so I can call Campisi's to get
salad delivery, so I'm out.

00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,769
Yeah, I'm out.

00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:07,737
John: To me, there's too many
gadgets out there, honestly.

00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:10,640
I‐I think people will buy it,
and they'll never use it,

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,443
even though it does work,
so I'm out.

00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:17,447
All right, Kevin.
[ Chuckles ]

00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:19,416
Um...

00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,418
If ‐‐ If you don't take
that deal...

00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:22,485
Yeah.
[ Laughing ]

00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:24,521
O'Leary:
... right now...

00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:25,622
Tyler,
it's a good deal.

00:40:25,622 --> 00:40:27,390
I wouldn't wait.

00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:33,496
Lori, would you consider
a royalty?

00:40:33,496 --> 00:40:35,465
Ooh.

00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:36,533
Greiner: A royalty?
What?!

00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:39,235
A royalty.
Okay. Tell me what ‐‐

00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:39,769
I'm curious.

00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:42,439
What kind of royalty
are you thinking?

00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,541
[ Sighs ]
How much per bowl?

00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:46,476
$1 per bowl.

00:40:46,476 --> 00:40:47,811
Mm.

00:40:47,811 --> 00:40:48,912
I know it's
a valuable product.

00:40:48,912 --> 00:40:50,947
I know people will buy it
when they see it.

00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:57,387
And I know that a partnership
with you is priceless.

00:40:57,387 --> 00:40:58,555
Here's what scares me.

00:40:58,555 --> 00:41:01,524
'Cause, you know,
I've done over 500 products.

00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:03,593
I know that when I first
started,

00:41:03,593 --> 00:41:05,862
I'd go into JCPenney,
they gave me a chance,

00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:07,831
and I would demonstrate
my earring organizer,

00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:10,567
and I would sell
a hundred a day.

00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:13,570
You've sold only 200
in all the trade shows

00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,737
you've done so far.
Mm‐hmm.

00:41:14,737 --> 00:41:16,039
So I'm taking a risk.

00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:18,875
The reason why I want the third
is because I know the work

00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,743
and the effort
that I'm gonna put in.

00:41:20,743 --> 00:41:22,712
Okay.
I'm gonna get it
on QVC.

00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:25,548
I have a built‐in audience
that trusts me and knows me.

00:41:25,548 --> 00:41:28,084
But this is gonna take
a lot of work by my team

00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:31,888
and myself to get this out there
into kitchen stores,

00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:34,791
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,
all the places that it can be.

00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:37,494
I'm just asking for 8% more
than what you offered,

00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:38,728
but here's the thing.

00:41:38,728 --> 00:41:40,630
You should answer me
right now.

00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,598
I know my value.

00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:42,765
Just as a reminder,

00:41:42,765 --> 00:41:45,869
I make millionaires.
That's what I do.

00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:52,075
My offer was $75,000
for 33 1/3%.

00:41:56,412 --> 00:41:57,881
Yes or no, Tyler?

00:41:57,881 --> 00:41:59,649
Um, Sharks,
I want to let you know

00:41:59,649 --> 00:42:00,817
I'm gonna take this deal.

00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:02,619
Yay!
[ Chuckles ]
Cuban: Smart.

00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:03,686
Good.
I'm glad.

00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:05,688
Not quite the fastest deal,
but...

00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:06,823
Well, I know
it wasn't the fastest...

00:42:06,823 --> 00:42:08,558
But good for you.
No, that's good for you, Tyler.

00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:09,726
Well done.
Did a great job.

00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:11,594

Well done, Tyler.
Thanks, Tyler.
