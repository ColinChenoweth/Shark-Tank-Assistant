I am done with the past,

00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,164
but it is
a learning experience for me.

00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,667
They always say
look back to learn,

00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:29,668
look forward to succeed.

00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,303
You're exactly right.

00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:33,104
Do you have any sales,

00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,205
or are you
still in development?

00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,776
We are up to $195,000
in sales.

00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:38,777
Wow.

00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,011
And what does one cost?

00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,080
One costs $29.95.

00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,882
What does it cost you
to make it?

00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,116
$14 apiece.

00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,319
Even at low volumes
at a $14 cost,

00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:51,089
this product could easily
support a $39.95 price point.

00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,857
I started at $59.95.

00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:53,959
Yes!
Now you're talking.

00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:54,960
What happened, though?
Then what happened?

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,127
And that was great.

00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,763
And I've had brides tell me
it's way too expensive.

00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,798
No!
It's too much.

00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:00,932
It's like, no,
why would you ‐‐

00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,001
Did your sales
start flatlining?

00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:06,204
It did. After a little while,
it started to go down.

00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,840
Heather, who's the biggest
retailer for wedding?

00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,908
I forget their name
right now.

00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:10,942
David's Bridal?

00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,977
Yeah. Have you
ever approached them?

00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,045
I have.
And what did they say?

00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,146
Their response was,

00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,148
is it doesn't
go with their merchandise.

00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,951
But it's a very needed thing.
They don't like
the potty association?

00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,419
Exactly.

00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:24,155
Cuban: Heather, let me kind of
clear things up a little bit.

00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,092
Congratulations to you
for overcoming your obstacles

00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:28,126
and chasing your dreams.

00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,061
I think you're gonna be
very successful.

00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,732
But the wedding industry is
not something I want to pursue,

00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:34,966
so I'm out.

00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,967
Thank you, Mark.

00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,202
You're welcome.

00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:41,373
$195,000 for a $29 item ‐‐
that's great.

00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:44,109
I mean, you're ‐‐ you're ‐‐
you're going somewhere.

00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,878
I think the price point
is too low.

00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:48,113
I think that...
I would agree.

00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,615
...it's gonna be
very difficult to sell it

00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,150
one at a time online,

00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,386
unless you can make
that retail association,

00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:59,891
'cause most brides would buy it
at the point of purchase.

00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,627
For that reason, I'm out.

00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:03,795
Okay.

00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:10,935
I would like to say something
on Heather's behalf.

00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,438
Heather is
an incredible human being.

00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,141
When she approached me
about this,

00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,942
I was already working
two jobs.

00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,911
And the idea
of tronking around on Sundays

00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,112
at bridal shows
for eight hours

00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,783
in a cold auditorium
was not all that appealing.

00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,117
But you know what?
I got up here,

00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:29,254
and I showed my underpants
to the international community

00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:30,855
because I believe
in Heather.

00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,190
And sometimes
when you love somebody,

00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,059
it means you show everybody
your underpants.

00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,860
She is brilliant.
[ Laughter ]

00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,128
And I'm telling you
right now ‐‐

00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,197
the way that brides
respond to this product,

00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,965
I think some of y'all
are making a mistake.

00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:41,933
They freak out.

00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,034
I had one lady tell me

00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,936
she had to army‐crawl
under her friend's wedding dress

00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,838
and tear her Spanx apart
with her bare hands.

00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:49,741
This is a product
that almost every single bride

00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,810
is going to want.

00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,111
Marissa,
you're a great salesperson.

00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,379
Do you have a piece
of the company?

00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,881
I'm the saleslady.
She's the inventor,
I'm the flasher.

00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,982
Herjavec:
Marissa, first of all,

00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,753
that is the best speech
we've ever had on here.

00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,755
Heather is
an inspiration.

00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:04,556
She clawed her way here.

00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:08,093
That's a very ‐‐
Hang on, hang on.
You are extremely loyal

00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:09,394
and very good friend.
After having heard that ‐‐

00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:14,165
And when I first started,
there were several people

00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,835
that were people
that I knew

00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,070
that just weren't
believers.

00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,372
And, you know,
what that did for me

00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:26,010
is it made a fire inside of me
to prove them wrong.

00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,780
And that's
what I see from you.

00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,181
They actually did you
a favor

00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:33,218
because they made you
stronger.

00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,887
So, what are you missing,
do you feel?

00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:36,955
I need connections.

00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,991
I need help to get
into those ‐‐

00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,660
for the companies
to listen to me.

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,029
I have an offer for you.

00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,999
I think I can help you
with the manufacturing of it.

00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,368
I think I could get
your costs <i>way</i> down

00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:54,172
so that you get it into retail
at a reasonable price.

00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,908
Mr. Wonderful
has a platform ‐‐

00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,977
Honeyfund
and all the other things.

00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:02,680
So we have discussed
going in together

00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,048
to give you an offer.

00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:08,286
We are thinking,
what if you bring her in?

00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,855
So ‐‐
I have to see her
in the deal.

00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,457
I have to see her
as part of the deal.

00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,224
He wants to see her in

00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,127
because you're by yourself.
Right.

00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:21,032
So you handle
whatever parts of the business

00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,133
that we're not
talking about here

00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,201
that you know
are important.

00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:24,435
Still got to hit the shows
with Marissa.

00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,572
You still got to go ‐‐
And you handle
the rest of the sales,

00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:28,239
and you help her.

00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,976
And we'd all be equal
partners ‐‐ 25, 25, 25, 25.

00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,912
If we get
all the great purchase orders,

00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,814
we'll help you fund
those purchase orders,

00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,015
specifically
for purchase orders.

00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,149
So you're taking
50% of her business.

00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,685
Yes.
Yes, it's gonna need that.

00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:41,252
Herjavec: Well, hang on.

00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,121
But I'm gonna take over
manufacturing.

00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,123
You're taking

She's working
for <i>you,</i> then.

00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:40,879
I have an offer.
We can't bring her in
like that.

00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,013
Let them figure this out.

00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,181
Excuse me.
You guys ‐‐

00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:46,217
You guys discuss
that very complicated thing.

00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,986
We're starting over.
I have
a very simple offer.

00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:49,821
When you told me

00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:52,023
that it took 10‐plus years
to get going,

00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:55,059
I'm telling in my head,
I was out right away.

00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,128
I'm thinking,
"How does it take 10 years?"

00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,863
But you know
what I've learned?

00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,899
I've learned as long
as you get back up there,

00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,000
who the heck cares
when it is?

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,936
But you stand and you get
counted for yourself.

00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,070
And I'm proud of that.

00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,973
And I was also reflecting
back on my boyfriend,

00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,975
who ran off
and married my secretary,

00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,210
who gave me
the gift of my life,

00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,746
when he said, "You'll never
succeed without me."

00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,748
All right?
So I get you.

00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,017
You're never going down
again.

00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:21,019
All right,
now here's my offer.

00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,755
I think the only
missing ingredient you have

00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,956
is salesmanship.

00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:27,992
And Marissa is
phenomenal at it.

00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,160
So here's the offer.

00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,332
It's $75,000
for 33% of your business.

00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,735
I'm gonna go back
because I didn't like the offer

00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:38,970
that we gave before.
Then why did you offer it?

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:39,971
I want to erase it.

00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,072
No, don't look back.
Look forward.

00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,974
Okay,
I'm looking forward.

00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,176
So, I don't want it
to have to be

00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,111
that you have to be
a partner.

00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,380
So if you want to have anything
to do with me with this,

00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,149
we have to
get rid of that.
That was a good offer.

00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,985
Here's the deal.
You get two Sharks.

00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,187
We'll drop down to 40%,
so we have 20% each.

00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,256
You decide
what to do with Marissa,

00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,792
but you still have
60% of the company.

00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:01,826
You decide what you want.

00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,028
There's no contingency
that she ha‐‐

00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,164
You work if you want,
you work if you don't want.

00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:09,634
Heather, you have two offers.
Sometimes offers go away.

00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,234
Stenlake: Absolutely.

00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:14,605
Lori, would you be willing
to come down a little bit

00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:15,606
in your percentage?

00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:16,607
To what?

00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,644
30%.

00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:22,780
Kevin?

00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,048
