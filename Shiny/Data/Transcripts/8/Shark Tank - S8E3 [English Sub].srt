at night.

That really appeals to me.

00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:23,555
I would do this ‐‐
$250,000 for 15%.

00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,826
You've got to grab that
right away.

I got a question for you.
Okay.

00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,334
You could take
Kevin's offer,

00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,603
or you could take
Robert's offer.

00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:44,476
Or you could take
what's behind door number two.

00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,644
Wouldn't you be
door number three by now?

00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,446
I don't have to be number three.
It's door number two.

But Lori also seems interested.

Do you have an offer,
Lori?

$300,000 for 20%.

00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:19,077
So, I'm gonna give you
a little bit more money,

00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:21,112
asking a little more equity.

00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,647
I'm not a runner.
I'm a walker.

00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,817
But I love it
because it's just smart product.

00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:28,520
Right.
And that's why I want
to be involved with it ‐‐

00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,155
'cause product's what I do.

00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,523
Wow.
Well, thank you very much.

for this opportunity...

every single one of you

What a schmoozer.

"...that we need."

So, we are ‐‐ Our sales
are increasing in
the Southern hemisphere.

00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,539
Remember, you have three offers
on the table.

Why are you keeping everybody
waiting as you're selling?

00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,409
Out of respect,
just out of respect.

00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,478
Stop selling.
Focus on the offers.
Okay.

00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:57,182
So, you have three offers ‐‐
Robert's $250,000 for 30%...

00:36:57,182 --> 00:37:00,518
Right.
... Lori's $300,000 for 20%,

00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,621
and I'm $250,000 for 15%.
Mm‐hmm.

00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,390
You've got to kind of
make a decision.

00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,327
Hey, Doug, so, listen ‐‐
I'm gonna change my offer.

00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:13,465
I'll give you $200,000
for 15%,

00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:16,101

the cash to buy inventory,

00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:16,735
get the product out.

00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:22,741
On top of that, I'll give you
$150,000 as a pure loan.

00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:24,309
Okay.

00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:28,546
So, my total offer is $350,000,
in effect, for 15%.

00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,583
But $150,000 of it is debt.
Is a loan.

00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,385
I'll throw in an offer
just to tell you where I'm at.

00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,321
It's gonna take
a lot of work.

00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:39,758
So, what I'll do is I'll
offer you the 250K for 30%,

00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:43,728
but I'll offer you unlimited
purchase‐order financing.

Mark's going the other way.
He's back up to the 30%.

00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,134
Could we have a minute
to talk about this?

00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:50,201
‐Absolutely.
‐Thank you.

good offers.

in tune with ‐‐ with running.

I'm not saying
the other ones aren't.

I don't like it
for the running market.

I like it
for everything else.

00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,421
But Kevin believes in
the occupational‐safety market.
Right.

00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,290
That's the highest valuation.
Right.

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,425
What about going in all together
for the 30%?

00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,494
Count me out.
I don't even get this product.

If we're gonna do that,

00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,397
why don't we go up
to 35% or something?

One of the risks
of leaving the room.

And that's always a risk
in "Shark Tank."

Sometimes it's good.
Sometimes it's bad.

00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:39,651
Let me explain.

00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:44,055
You've now got two offers
across four Sharks,

$250,000 for 30%.
And the financing.

00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,531
The other three Sharks
really like that offer a lot.

00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,699
We're gonna make the same.

00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,701
You're gonna get three Sharks
for the same amount.

00:38:56,701 --> 00:39:00,538
We'll give you the $250,000
for 30%, three Sharks,

with all the benefits
they have.

00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,375
They decided to copy me
for obvious reasons.

00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,277
But, you know,
competition happens.

00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,312

‐Not mine.
‐Okay.

Not ours.
You just got
a lot of work to do.

00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,465
If you really want the benefit
of multiple Sharks,

00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,301
you got to leave them a little
bit of meat on the bone.

That's a Sharky move.

There's no unity on the team
anymore.

00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:50,555
Obviously, these alignments

00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,056

00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:16,834
They were very calm.

00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,270
All they did was let the Sharks
go at each other.
I know.

00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,438
And she was freaking out
the entire time...

00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:21,472
But they didn't
move on it.

00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,507
...'cause they knew
they had no cash.

00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:23,574
15 grand in the bank ‐‐
that's scary.

00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,672
They were smart.
Good luck, Robert.
