you know, step up
and really help out the family.

00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,069
And my first business
was when I was 21.

00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,270
I ran a coffee shop.

00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,105
So, I worked there
every single day

00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,041
while paying for
my college tuition

00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,442
and going to school.

00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:28,180
And, obviously, having
the first business, I failed.

00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,448
Why do you think
it failed?

00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,383
I didn't have a vision
for the business,

00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,220
so I just worked
every single day

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,421
just to pay the bills.

00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,389
And when
it came down to it,

00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,358
I just didn't see
where I could take this.

00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,693
So, I called it quits.

00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:44,363
But afterwards, I just
started thinking about,

00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,198
"I could have
done this differently,"

00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,634
and that really
fired me up.

00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:51,403
When I first started
this business,

00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,472
I had $30,000 in savings,

00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,542
and I maxed out my credit card
just to survive for six months.

00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,277
No, but you know what,
that says something.

00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,379
You started
your coffee shop.
Yes.

00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,215
You paid
for your college,

00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,551
and you managed
to save $30,000.

00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,386
That's right.
Let me just tell you,

00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,488
every day, people give me
E‐mails saying,

00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,457
"Oh, my goodness,
I need to borrow money.

00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,492
Oh, my goodness, I need
to go out and raise money."

00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,593
And they always say,
"What's the best way?"

00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,196
And I always say, "Save."
Right?

00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,331
And you're just
the perfect example of that.

00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:23,302
If you bust your ass and you
cut your costs, you can save.

00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:25,170
And so bravo, man.
Thank you.

00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,205

Really good.

I like the fresh elements to it.
I can see why it sells.

00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,512
Let's get into the numbers
a little bit.

00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:37,082
Last year,
we did $4.7 million.

00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,584
Yeah!
$4.7 million.

00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,286
That's badass.
How much from the trucks?

00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:43,555
Food trucks are around
$300,000 to $400,000.

00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:48,160
Restaurants are doing
about $1 million to
$1.5 million per unit.

00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,495
We've maximized our growth.

00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:52,298
But it really comes down to,
you know,

00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:55,334
I need more money
to really grow.

00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,369
Hey, Jae,
can we take a step back?
Sure.

00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,537
Now that
I'm catching my breath,

00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,372
that's some of the best food
I've ever eaten.

00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,241
‐Thank you, Chris.
‐It's absolutely delicious.

00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,310
And I can see why
you've had this success.

00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,379
So, are you gonna hit
$5 million‐plus sales next year?

00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,615
Yes, we're gonna be
doing $6 million this year.

00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:13,852
So, you have actually
lived the American Dream
and every essence of it.

00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:14,420
‐Amen.
‐Mm‐hmm.

00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,454
I try my best.

00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,089
How many restaurants,
how many trucks

00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:17,756
do you want to have?

00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,693
My goal is 15 restaurants
doing $15 million in revenue.

00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:24,396
Jae, I've invested
in a number of restaurants.

00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,665
I think our most well‐known
is "Veggie Grill."

00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,201
But when we invest
in those restaurants,

00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,536
we're not
the growth capital.

00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,604
We're the people who are helping
them in the early days

00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,640
try and completely
change the game.

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,475
We're bringing
plant‐based food affordably.

00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,211
And really delicious food
to a brand‐new audience

00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,512
was what got us
into that deal,

00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:44,683
not helping them scale from
20 locations to 50 to 100.

00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,419
You're kicking a lot of ass,
and it's absolutely delicious.

00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,456
But, you haven't told me
what you are uniquely doing

00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,458
to change the landscape
for everybody else.

00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:56,261
And so, as they say, if it's
not a "hell yes," it's a no.

00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,030
So, unfortunately,
I'm out.

00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,499
Thank you, Chris.

00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,301
My challenge
with your deal, Jae,

00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,536
is having invested
in restaurants in the past

00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,439
and not having
a good outcome as a result,

00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,341
it's made me
a little more skeptical

00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,476
about that part
of your business.

00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,378
So, when you open
a new restaurant,

00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:14,980
if the location doesn't work
for any reason,

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,382
you can't just move it.

00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:19,485
You have a lease, you've got
a lot of capital tied up.

00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:22,221
I don't like
that part of your deal.

00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,322
For that reason, I'm out.

00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:25,257
Thank you.

00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,527

watching.

you do it.

more valuable than cash.

00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,171

I love it.

a restaurant guy.

I get pitched restaurants
every day.

00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,309
In order to do them right,

00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,412
to be anything other
than dumb capital,

00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:48,547
you've got to be there
helping side‐by‐side.

00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,950

a fit for me right now.

as a good investment for me.

00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,634

about your model of growing.

00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,270

if you really get a good hold

00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,107

What are you
gonna do, Barbara?

00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,484
I've learned that people
that start a food business,

00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,453
if they're any good
and worth their salt,

00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:30,389
that they're very good people
in their soul.

00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:31,723
Because you're serving food
to people,

00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:35,160
and that takes a certain type
of entrepreneur, right?

00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,329
I have one investment
in Tom + Chee.

00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,199

with $1.2 million

00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,300
when they were
in "Shark Tank,"

00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,135
and they were
a baby business,

00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,237
but at least had
one truck, two shops.

00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:48,340
And now they're doing
$51 million in sales.

00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,441

their business.

they jumped over.

I know how to franchise,
how not to franchise,

00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:01,153

a franchise play.

take more advantage

are interested.

But what
I don't want you to do

00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,374
is judge me
as a financial partner,

00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,409
because I'm a heck of a lot more
than that.

00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:52,691
Wouldn't it be great
if you could tour

00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,327
that property right there,
on the spot?

00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,296
Well, thanks to me, you can.

00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,330
[ Scattered chuckles ]

00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,098
I'd like to introduce you
to Toor,

00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,100
the world's smartest lockbox.

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,402
Toor is the first lockbox

00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,437
that allows
buyers and sellers

00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:08,507
to access the lockbox
with or without an agent.

00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:11,243
Wow.
Barbara, I know
you've opened some doors

00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:12,244
in your career.

00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,245
I'd love some help.
Sure.

00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,446
Thank you, dear.
Thank you.

00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:16,515
Desinor: So, imagine Barbara's
driving down a street

00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,417
and she sees
a property for sale.

00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,551
She pulls it up
on the Toor app.

00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,420
She immediately
sends a request.

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,788
The seller
approves her showing,

00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,390
and immediately, Barbara
is able to tour the property.

00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,993
So, Barbara,
simply walk up to the box.

00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:28,694
Mm‐hmm, okay.

00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:32,597
Press the power button
until you see that color wheel.

00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,567
Okay, now simply
press "open" on the app.

00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,037
Okay, easy enough.
There you go.

00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,440
That's the coolest part!
Now the lockbox opens up.

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,441
Okay.
That's the coolest part.

00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:43,542
She'll grab the keys,

00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:46,011
tour the property on her own
or with a Realtor.

00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,279
Feel like a winner.

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,015
Now, once your done, put
the keys back in the lockbox.

00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,183
Okey dokey.

00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,318
And simply press "close"
on the app.

00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:55,320
There you go.

00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,423
Give it a second,
and it will close right up.

00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,624
The seller gets
a notification

00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,426
saying Barbara's
completed her tour,

00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,161
and now Barbara can
leave feedback

00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,363
and be on her way.

00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,330
Thank you so much.

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,132
Nice handshake.
Thank you.

00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,433
‐Nice suit.
‐Thank you.

00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,303
Desinor: So, Sharks, which one
of you guys wants to join me

00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:14,339
in opening this door
to opportunity?

00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,375
O'Leary: Junior,
while it's fresh on my mind...
Yes.

00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,244
... what happens if the person
who just did the tour

00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,314
does not redeposit the key,
but closes it anyways?

00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,416
If that key is removed
for a set period of time

00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,584
that you,
the seller, sets,

00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:28,220
you get a notification
if that key is not put back.

00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,454
Greiner:
But if it were my home,

00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,357
I'm not sure I would want
somebody to go in unescorted.

00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,259
Great question.
So, the beauty of our product

00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,694
is that you, the seller ‐‐
you get to determine

00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,529
what type of showing
you want in your house.

00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,232
So, if you want
an agent present,

00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,733
you simply require
an agent present.

00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,569
That's very cool,
because, normally,
you have to wait...

00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,704
Absolutely.
... you have
to find somebody,

00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:48,206
that have to go get a key
back at the office.

00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,408
You got it, you got it,
you got it.

00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,243
Junior, numbers.
How much have you sold?

00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,044
Yeah, so, zero.

00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,479
‐Zero?
‐Zero sales.

00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,747
Junior,
you're killing me!

00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,283
It's 'cause we're brand‐new.
But, fortunately, we had a ‐‐

00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,185
Do you want your punishment
now or later?

00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,319
No, no, no, later.
Later.

00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,388
Wait, hear me out.
Hear me out.

00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,490
So, fortunately, we had a
successful Kickstarter campaign.

00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,194
We actually sold over 800 boxes,
raising over $100,000.

00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:10,228
‐Amazing.
‐Wow.

00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,263
So, we have over
$100,000 in pre‐sales.

00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,497
How much are you
selling them for?

00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,333
So, the lockbox itself
is $199.

00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,368
What does it cost you
to make them?

00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:20,272
$50, and then $75 delivered
to the customer.

00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,207
I'm very curious
what your background is.

00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,308
I'm a real‐estate broker.

00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,242
You <i>sound</i> like
a real‐estate broker.

00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,477
[ Laughs ]
Sure does!

00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,612
I flipped my first house
when I was 18 years old.

00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,347
When I was at college
at Texas Tech,

00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,249
I was president
of the real‐estate organization.

00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,350
Were you really?

00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,618
Why is it that you like
real estate so much?

00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,388
Great question.
So, my parents are from Haiti.

00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,324
They worked hard to put me
in a very nice private school.

00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,460
All my best friends lived
in literally the nicest ‐‐

00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,162
Mark Cuban's neighborhood,
to be exact.

00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,497
Ever since I saw
these big houses,

00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:46,598
I fell in love
with real estate.

00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:50,068
Okay, Junior,
Defend your $5 million ‐‐

00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,236
Before you get
to that ‐‐

00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:53,371
Let me let it roll off
my lips ‐‐ $5 million.

00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:54,606
How much money have you
invested in this, Junior.

00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,274
I'm not gonna stop,
I don't know why ‐‐

00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,342
Kevin, I'm ready.
I'm ready.

00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,345
Tell me why it's worth
$5 million.

00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,680
Here's how we make money.

00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,449
We charge a monitoring fee
for these lockboxes.

00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,084
How much
is the monthly?

00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,085
$100 a month.

00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,620
‐Ooh.
‐Wow! What?

00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,855
That's a lot of money.
Nooo, guys.

00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:12,190
Barbara, please, educate
these guys on how much...
[ Laughter ]

00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,161
...Realtors spend
every month, guys.

00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,262
It strikes me
as a lot of money.

00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:20,499
Look, last Saturday, I visited
15 homes in a day ‐‐

00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,667
each with
an electronic lockbox on it.
Right.

00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,436
The agents just
held their phone up.
That's it. You got it.

00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:25,504
With Bluetooth,
they get in.

00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,771
So, these devices
exist already.

00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,274
Yeah, but ‐‐
So you have one
incremental change on that,

00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,775
which is an interface
where a user can say,

00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,777
"Yes, I'll let people in when
there isn't an agent there."

00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,613
That's the only thing that
you're doing that's different.

00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:36,548
No. No, no, no.
Tell me what's ‐‐
What's different?

00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,183
Here's what's ‐‐
I mean,
I literally used this ‐‐

00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,217
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,685
Give him a chance, cowboy.
Calm down.

00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,321
You had to wait on that agent
to let you in, right?

00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,490
Yeah. So, the only thing
you have different

00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,359
is the interface that
lets the seller say...
That's a big difference.

00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,493
... go ahead an open it up.
No!

00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,328
Chris, imagine ‐‐
It's a big difference,

00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,396
but that's not necessarily
defensible.

00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,731
‐Calm down, calm down.
‐Let him talk.

00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:55,300
Imagine if you could
see five properties in
one day on your own,

00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,335
as opposed
to calling your agent,

00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,703
the agent calls
the showing company,

00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,206
the showing company calls
the listing agent...
Look, Junior, Junior, I ‐‐

00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,440
...the listing agent calls
the seller,

00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,575
the seller confirms it.
That's right.

00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,243
They go back
to the listing agent,

00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,678
The listing agent calls
the showing company,

00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:09,381
the showing company then
confirms with the buying agent.

00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,917
Junior, nobody hates
wasting time more than I do.

00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:12,584
But why can't the company

00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:15,153
that already has
massive market share

00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,288
do exactly this?

00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:19,391
If you look at
the incumbents in our industry,

00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,293
they're old, they're dated.

00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,461
Their technology's old.
They have no platform.

00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,630
They're so disconnected
from Realtors today.

00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,399
Anyone in real‐estate ‐‐
You can't convince me

00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,533
that somebody
who actually has

00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,102
a smart lockbox
operated by Bluetooth

00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,170
is old and disconnected.

00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,505
I mean, it's, like,
two‐year‐old technology.

00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:36,575
But there's way‐‐
our platform is more
than just a lockbox.

00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,510
Literally,
the verification part

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,614
of what you're doing
is the easiest part.

00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,584
So, what is, would you say,
your secret sauce?

00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,353
I don't know if you have
any IP on this, or what.

00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:49,487
‐We do, we do.
‐What is that?

00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,622
We're patent pending ‐‐

00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:53,258
the ability to open and close
the lockbox mechanically

00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,526
without physically closing,

00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,162
which enables our remote
opening and closing.

00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,229
And no one else
can do that?

00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,831
‐You got it.
‐What?

00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:00,365
Correct.

00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:01,600
No, that technology
exists today!

00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,502
No, not on a lockbox.
Absolutely not.

00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,503
Where have you seen
a real ‐‐

00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,571
You're absolutely
kidding me.

There is not
a single lockbox out there

00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:09,407
that can close on its own.

00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,276
You know what,
don't be so arrogant.

00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,411
I'm not so arrogant.
I just know this space,

00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,480
and I'm sitting here
watching somebody tell us

00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,282
that this dated technology
isn't what it is.

00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,484
So, what lockbox
can close on its own?

00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,486
[ Stammers ]
So, let me see
if I get this.

00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,387
Hold on.
My God.

00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:23,421
Let me see if I get this.

00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,456
And poor Chris is having
his disconnect.

00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,358
[ Laughing ] Chris.

00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,094
When Chris went
to look at 15 homes,

00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,695
how did you schedule
those 15?

00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,664
We had an agent take us
to half of them.

00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,466
I saw half on my own.
No, no,
that's not what I asked.

00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,501
That's not what I asked.
How did you schedule them?

00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,871
You made a plan to go see
15 homes in a development.
Yeah.

to buy a house...

Oh, geez. Should we get
the violin music out?

Just listen.
Listen.
