what was your first business?

00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:59,465
My first, sort of,
was to start a magazine

the Vietnamese War
that was going on.

00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:05,438

magazine for young people...

my education, but...

But you're gonna stay at school,

00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:11,344
so you're gonna have to learn
to delegate...
Yeah.

00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:14,480
...because too many people think
they can do it all themselves.

00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,349

that you had gotten

you can't make them anymore.

is ‐‐ you know, a gold digger

00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,796
felt a little harsh to me.

00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:28,265
Part of what we're able
to accomplish on our show...
Yeah.

00:41:28,265 --> 00:41:29,367
...in our nine years

00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,402
is educating
potential entrepreneurs.
Right.

00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:34,138
I do the show because
kids that watch the show learn.

00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:35,506
When I called this woman
a gold digger,

00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:37,475
it wasn't a disrespect to her
or her company

00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:39,310
or what she's been able
to accomplish.

00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,478
It was the fact
that she didn't care

00:41:40,478 --> 00:41:42,246
if she got a deal.
She was here only because ‐‐

00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:43,314
Herjavec:
That's not true, Mark.

00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:44,482
Oh, without question.

00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:45,716
And she ‐‐ We see it all
the time with Silicon Valley.

00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:47,618
Let's take ‐‐
Let's take the other point.
Hang on a second.

00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:50,354
You're telling her she doesn't
have the right to be here.
No! Robert, no.

00:41:50,354 --> 00:41:52,723
You know what it takes
to get a deal on this show.

00:41:52,723 --> 00:41:55,259
We've seen people, particularly
from Silicon Valley,

00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:56,460
who look at us as a growth hack.

00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,331
They could care less if they got
our money or our expertise.

00:42:00,331 --> 00:42:02,133
They just wanted
the commercial.

00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:03,234
I think that's wrong.

00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:05,269
We're blowing something up
completely unfairly and ‐‐

00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:08,172
She's smart.
This is "Shark Tank," right?

00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:09,607
You are here
to come in and get a deal,

00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:11,442
and the whole idea
that we have Sharks

00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:13,377
is because we're supposed
to add more value

00:42:13,377 --> 00:42:14,578
than any of the other
investors out there.

00:42:14,578 --> 00:42:16,213
You're ‐‐ You're gonna get
the deal that Mark Cuban likes?

00:42:16,213 --> 00:42:17,648
Why can't she get
the deal that she wants?

00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:19,483
Branson: Tell you what I find
slightly embarrassing ‐‐

00:42:19,483 --> 00:42:21,519
We're talking about
a meditation ‐‐ a meditation ‐‐

00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,421
[ Laughter ]
...a meditation...

00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:25,990
‐We need some meditation.
‐I need a hair dryer.
