00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:03,604
Narrator: We celebrate
the risk‐takers...

00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:06,373
Why not quit the job
and go for it?

00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,875
...the idea‐makers...

00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,610
We can really change
the world together.

00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,845
Ahh!
Narrator: ...the ones who
determine their own fate.

00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,747
‐Whoo!
‐We got a deal!

00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,683
Narrator:
We celebrate entrepreneurs.

00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,152
I want y'all to think ‐‐
who's next?

00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,688
Narrator:
This is "Shark Tank."

00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,258
And tonight, billionaire founder
of the Virgin Group,

00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,093
Richard Branson, joins the Tank.

00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,828
What I love
about "Shark Tank"

00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,330
is everyday people
solving everyday problems.

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,833
If you know anyone that owns
an airline, let me know.

00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,668
This is not a cheap business
to get into.

00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,303
This is
a completely different business.

00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,272
Last year was about $3 million.
Wow.

00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,606
The only way
to figure this thing out

00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,208
is to study people's DNA.

00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,476
I'll make you an offer,
but I want you

00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,610
to say yes or no
right now.

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,245
Well, we have a guest here.
Forget him.

00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,313
Isn't that a great offer?

00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,949
What would you offer
for two or three Sharks?

00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:51,552
Uh, depends on the Sharks.

00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,619
What?

00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,194
Narrator: First into the Tank
is a product

00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,830
created to solve a problem
the entrepreneur had

00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,332
as a fighter‐jet mechanic.

00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:14,508
♪♪

00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,677
Hello, Sharks.
My name's Tom Burden.

00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,179
I'm from the small farm town
of Celina, Ohio,

00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,381
and I'm seeking $200,000

00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,684
in exchange for 10%
of my company.

00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,252
Sharks, let me ask you
a question.

00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,088
Have you ever been inspired
by a really good idea

00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,290
when doing maintenance
on a fighter‐jet machine gun?

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,792
Oh.
All the time.

00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,460
Oh, yeah.
Every day.

00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,928
Well, I have.

00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,731
I'm an F‐16 weapons mechanic
in the United States Air Force,

00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,701
and I encounter a problem
time and time again.

00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,436
When working
on top of the aircraft,

00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,338
I'm constantly trying
to keep my tools close

00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,772
and my hardware organized.

00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,874
Seems like a simple enough task,

00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,610
but on the aircraft's
slick surface,

00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,511
it is nearly impossible.

00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,614
Would you believe me
if I told you that,

00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,782
in general aviation,
to solve this problem,

00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,886
mechanics are using anything
from rags, muffin trays,

00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,656
and, my favorite,
urinal cakes.

00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,692
Yes.
Hopefully clean urinal cakes.

00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,895
Clearly, these products
just aren't cutting it.

00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:12,766
To solve this problem,
I introduce to you the Grypmat.

00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,302
It's a flexible,
nonslip tool tray

00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,671
ensuring that your tools
and hardware

00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,439
stay in place on any surface.

00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,843
We currently have three sizes ‐‐
the small, medium, large ‐‐

00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,511
all equipped with the ability

00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,513
to hold tools
up to a 70‐degree angle.

00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,382
Let me show you how it works.

00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,317
The small's equipped
with six compartments

00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,319
to keep your hardware
organized.

00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,125
The medium
has two small compartments

00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,861
and an open field
for hand tools.

00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,563
And then the large
has four small compartments,

00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,198
an open field for hand tools,

00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:49,302
and then handles so you can
easily move your workstation.

00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,605
Although the Grypmat
was born into aviation,

00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,640
it can be found useful
in every field,

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,909
whether it's making hats
out of your garage,

00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,978
building rockets,
assembling computers,

00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,212
making jewelry,

00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,481
or tinkering underneath
the hood of your car.

00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,583
So, Sharks,
one question remains ‐‐

00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,986
who here is ready to get a grip?

00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,021
A Grypmat, that is.

00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,456
Cuban: Do you have samples
for us to look at?

00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,591
Yes.
And thank you
for your service.

00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,559
‐Thank you.
‐Absolutely.

00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,595
‐Yeah.
‐So, this is the medium.

00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,065
The medium is actually
the most popular size.

00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,299
Right.

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,968
So, if you notice,
on the medium and the large,

00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,071
there's also
a measurement system.

00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,340
Branson:
What I love about "Shark Tank"

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,777
is that everyday people
are solving everyday problems.

00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:35,048
With Virgin Galactic in mind
and with our airlines in mind,

00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,717
um, yeah,
this would be tremendous.

00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,051
Our engineering teams,

00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,787
they would welcome
something like this enormously.

00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,622
You can make
an offer right now.
Richard, Richard ‐‐

00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,124
If you know anyone
that owns an airline,

00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,126
let me know, and we could ‐‐
we could ‐‐

00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,395
Branson: Look, I tell you what,
we would definitely buy them.

00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,997
So, the question is whether you
can make money as a business,

00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,299
so...
Have you sold any yet?

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,366
Do you have
a business here yet?
Yes.

00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,102
So, we've sold
roughly 10,000 units,

00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,237
total of $400,000
in sales.
Oh.

00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,005
And when did you
start selling?

00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,875
We started selling, um,
roughly 10 months ago.

00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,176
What was your net?

00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,978
So, between $150,000
and $200,000,

00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,647
which I've taken that and
reinvested it into inventory.

00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,416
‐Wow.
‐Good for you. Good for you.

00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,851
That's impressive.
‐That's great.

00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,452
John: All right, where have
you been selling them?

00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:16,656
Yeah. So, um, the big thing
has been, um, selling online.

00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,126
Trade shows have been
very significant for us.

00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,695
So far, I've gotten
a handful of, um, fighter jets,

00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,730
and then, also,
I've sold to NASA.

00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,633
We're specifying
in the aviation industry,

00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,002
and we're about to grow
into the automotive industry.

00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,004
Are you gonna go into retail
with ‐‐ with it at all?

00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,573
That's something, honestly,
I need guidance on

00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,243
of how to navigate with ‐‐
especially with the big‐box.

00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:38,145
Um, it's my understanding,
they'll really push you around.

00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,980
What's the application
for cars, though?

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,915
I'm underneath the car,
everything's flat.

00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,617
Right, if you're working
underneath the hood of the car,

00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,118
typically what you're doing
is you're scattering your tools

00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,419
all over the engine.

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,555
So your tools are typically,
like, black or silver,

00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,090
which just blend in
to the engine.

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,492
So, like, the key thing
within the product

00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,395
is getting the user in the habit
of putting the tools

00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,597
into the tray,
so building that habit.

00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,599
Okay. So, what do you
sell them for at retail,

00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,034
what's your cost?
Yeah.

00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,804
So, retail,
the small is $29.99.

00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,273
The medium is $44.99.
‐Wow.

00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,475
The large is $69.99.

00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,278
Landed cost
is roughly 25% of that.

00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,746
Is this silicone?

00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,381
It's a silicone‐polymer mix.

00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,750
Silicone goes to
500 degrees.
Correct.

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,418
Let's say on an engine
or if it's hot,

00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,786
that's not gonna melt.
Correct.

00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,521
Silicone
goes to 500 degrees?

00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,722
‐It does.
‐You're smart, lady.

00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,658
You're smart.
[ Laughter ]

00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,461
So, aren't there other silicone
trays out there, or no?

00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,931
No, basically, the hot thing
that's been selling is just ‐‐

00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,432
it's a sheet of material.

00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,568
So, t‐the big thing
is having the lip

00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,069
so things can't, like,
roll down.

00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,671
Have you applied to any ‐‐
for any patents or anything?

00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,173
Yes, right now, we have
a‐a utility patent pending.

00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,475
So, how much have you
invested so far?

00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,245
So, personal money,
about $40,000,

00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:48,048
and then also raised
about $150,000

00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,217
through grants and doing
business competitions.

00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,619
You are incredible,
my friend.

00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,588
So, Tom,
what ‐‐ what's the next step?

00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:58,725
My vision for the company is to
keep inv‐inventing new products.

00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,427
Um, that's something
that I see a lot

00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,596
that's a big problem
within the startup community

00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,497
is that they're not
innovative people.

00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,700
It's people
with an innovative idea.

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,635
They have one good idea,
and they can't make 2.0,

00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,737
they can't shock the world
with the next generation.

00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,138
So, what is your 2.0?

00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,808
I want to have more products
that integrate with the Grypmat,

00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,877
things that would attach
to the Grypmat,

00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,545
if it's a flashlight,
a magnet,

00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,280
or if it's, you know,
something with a lid.

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,849
If you're gonna be the chief
innovation officer, right,

00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,851
Yes.
...who's gonna run
the company?

00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,188
Uh, that's where
I'm slowly building a team.

00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,825
Okay. So your challenge appears
to be back office,

00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,261
putting together
a sales force, right?
Right.

00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:37,163
Having an organization
already in place...
Right.

00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,232
...so you can focus on...
Innovation.

00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,700
...innovation
while somebody else

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,602
handles all the nuts and bolts
of the business.

00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,870
Yes.

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,739
I'm curious about you.

00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,708
You said that you grew up
in a small town in Ohio.

00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,477
Yes.
Can you tell us
about yourself?

00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,646
Growing up, I always
wanted to be an inventor.

00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,048
Came time to go to college,
my parents told me

00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,450
that they weren't going to
pay for my college,

00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,718
so, um, to call their bluff,

00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,954
I told them
I was gonna join the military.

00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,923
Turns out they weren't bluffing,
and...

00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,291
[ Laughter ]

00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,660
...so now I've been in the
service for eight years now.

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,229
What are you gonna do
with the $200,000?

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,431

is that there are subtypes

off your genes in you DNA.

00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,576
So the only way
to figure this thing out

00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,944
is to study people's DNA.

00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:42,181

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,527

00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,603
It's more environmentally
friendly,

and, frankly,
it's better margin.

00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,606
But the problem
isn't the margin.

00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,074
The problem is
the capital cost, right?

00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,909
What's it cost per customer?

00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,911
So ‐‐ Yeah ‐‐ So, the
manufacturers are very motivated

00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,346
to move this
into the U. S.

00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:30,182

for the first month,

we still don't pay
the manufacturer.

00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,123
And then,
the next month,

00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,793
we pay them $45 a month as
a lease model on the mower.

00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,962
Isn't their grand incentive
to be that

00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,932

to people here in America?

Crandall: They would love to
sell them to Americans,

and go,

"Okay. Now I'm going out
to do the edging,

and I'm gonna do the shrub
trimming and the weeding?"

00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,143
And if you tried to hire
that same landscaper,

he's not gonna give you
a discount

All my aunts and uncles
were teachers.

I think I'm the black sheep
'cause I went into business,

00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:38,850
but that was where
my passion was.

00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,887
Got my MBA at Harvard, and I
moved down to Austin in 2005,

00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,722
joined some startups
down there,

00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,692
and then ran sales for another
e‐commerce‐related business

from about half a million
to $15 million in revenue

00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,462
over three years.

You're an online guy.

00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:54,233
Yep. I met Bart through
a mutual friend of ours,

00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,768
and we started talking
about this lawn‐care idea.

00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,238
I was like, "This is just
too ‐‐ too good to pass up."

00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,707
How much money have you raised,
and how big is the team?

00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:04,176
So, we've raised
just over $3 million,

00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:07,179
and we have 10 full‐time
team members right now,

00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:10,515

80 crews that we contract with.

00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,351
What were
your sales last year?

00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,052

Okay. So, making something
self‐balancing

00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,808
is very difficult.

00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,077
That's why you had to get it
moving first, yeah.
Yeah, exactly.

00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:55,013
And we spent almost a year
doing the mathematics on this.

00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:57,949
And our very significant
e‐learning platform app,

00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,452
SugarCoded,
is very special in the sense

00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,520
that we put girls
in the center.

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,922
It's very story‐based.

00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:06,491
And did you release this onto
the market yet?

00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,660
We've only been on the market
for less than six months.

00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,761
Okay.

00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,296
And we've done $250,000
worth of sales

00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,764
in that really short
period of time.

00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,365
‐Wow.
‐Nice.

00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,134
How did you get your sales?

00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:19,104
So, um, the first thing
that I did was actually,

00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:22,207
I went to the World's Toy Fair
with six prototypes.

00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,976
I walked away with 300 names
of different companies

00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,412
who were interested
in the product, and I thought,

00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,081
"You know what? This is gonna ‐‐
This is gonna be big."

00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,383
So then I started to
talk to some of them,

00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:35,487
and I was able to actually get
some distributor agreements,

00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,489
and that helped me
raise the funds.

00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,724
So, the $250,000
is from one distributor,

00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,359
a couple
of distributors?

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,796
It's for distributors,
also direct from retail,

00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,331
also from Amazon.

00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,166
So, where is it now, Sharmi?
Where can I see the ‐‐

00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,535
It's available
online on our website.

00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,470
What does it sell for?
I don't think we ever asked you.

00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,672
Yeah, so it sells for
$79.99.

00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,141
And what does it cost you
to make it?

00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:58,777
‐About $18, landed.
‐Okay. Wow. That's great.

00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,646
Let us know why you think
the company's worth
$4 million at this point.

00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,282
One of the things
is how difficult it is

00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,850
to do
the balancing algorithm.

00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,585
And it makes it very special.

00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,421
We could actually license or
sell the balancing algorithm.

00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:11,589
It's very unique.

00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:12,957
I tell you, that self‐balancing
thing is cool.

00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,693
Doesn't it look like Richard
just met Lori, like...

00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,763
[ Laughter ]
"Hey! You want some tea?"

00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,431
Is this a patent on this?

00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,901
We have a provisional patent
on our product.

00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,703
I think this is valuable,
because out of the young ladies

00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,605
that do go into engineering,

00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:30,175
70% end up dropping out
of engineering

00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,410
because they don't have other
females that they can relate to.
Yeah, exactly.

00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,445
And I think if you get them
in early enough,

00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,147
they will have
more females.

00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,082
I'm interested
in licensing this thing out,

00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,217
but you're asking a lot.

00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:40,985
I would have to give you
the $200,000...

00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:43,988
...for 30%.

00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,532
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in.

00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,434
Daymond is interested
in SmartGurlz,

00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,570
an engineering toy
geared towards girls,

00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,972
but he wants a much bigger stake
of the company

00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:03,708
than the 5%
Sharmi came in offering.

00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:07,412
I would have to give you
the $200,000 for 30%.

00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,784
Okay. Well, that's ‐‐
that's a lot.

00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,520
Herjavec: Um, you know,
been in the toy business.

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,123
The Barbie doll, the 800‐pound
gorilla in that business,

00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:22,093
sales have declined
the last couple of years.

00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,394
But they're still ‐‐

00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,630
I mean, one is sold
every three seconds, so...

00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,165
There's nothing
to connect with them.

00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,633
I applaud ‐‐ I applaud
what you're doing,

00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:33,238
but the incarnation
of that idea is this doll.

00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:35,673
And I think it's ‐‐
it's tough.

00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,543
It's a tough,
tough business to be in.

00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,411
Um...

00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,181
Yeah, I don't want to
go back into it.

00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,249
I'm out.

00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,186
Greiner:
Let me tell you what I think.

00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:51,155
I did a deal with Robert
that was a doll

00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,991
that had imperfections ‐‐

00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,926
cellulite and one eye
that's crooked

00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:56,995
and, you know, all these things,
like normal people.

00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,564
What happened is
that Barbie came out

00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,600
with the exact same thing ‐‐
kind of crushed us.

00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,869
I mean, this is
a completely different business.

00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,171
If you go to the toy store
today, in the robotics section,

00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:11,276
there is not one toy that's
specifically aimed at girls.

00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:14,479
Such a smart idea,
but I really think

00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,682
that Daymond's licensing offer
is the smartest thing,

00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:19,417
'cause he's expert at that.

00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,585
I have to be out.

00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,223
It's so great
when you're learning things

00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:26,791
and you don't know
you're learning things.

00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,493
I mean, you're just playing.
Yeah, exactly.

00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:31,396
Obviously, all of us would love
our kids to ‐‐ to learn to code,

00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,064
and I love
what you're doing.

00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:34,432
I think it's ‐‐
it's great.

00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,801
But I don't think
I can add enough value

00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,604
to your business to invest.

00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,072
So, sadly, I'm out.

00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,907
Okay.

00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:47,378
Retail is brutal.

00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,113
I like everything
about your company

00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,649
except the fact that you have
a product that's in retail.

00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:55,086
You're still vulnerable
to every new product

00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:56,421
that comes in
trying to teach

00:40:56,421 --> 00:41:00,625
robotics/programming/whatever
to girls.

00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,626
I'm out.

00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,631
Herjavec: So, Daymond,
you're at $200,000 for 30%?

00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:07,799
Yeah.

00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,134
Is there any wiggle room
in the...

00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,871
You know,
the challenge is...

00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,707
Let's just talk
industry standard.

00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:19,344
A normal licensing agent is
normally around 25% to 35%.

00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:20,812
They don't pay you anything.

00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,480
They just get it
and go represent it.

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,416
I'm paying you $200,000
to go out and license it.

00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,353
Make him a counteroffer, Sharmi.
What's your downside?

00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:33,958
Would you come back with 20%?

00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,428
You won't regret it.

00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,300
We will do a great job for you.
I am so dedicated to this.

00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,768
I‐I'm planning
on the licensing part.

00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,136
I'm gonna have to stay
at 30%.
You know...

00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,540
25%?

00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,577
We're meeting ‐‐
For $200,000?

00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:53,644
Yes, yeah. And it's so far ‐‐

00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,079
The idea is for us
to go and license it.

00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,280
Yes, it is.

00:41:58,483 --> 00:41:59,484
You got a deal.

00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,119
‐Yeah!
‐Yay!

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,253
Thank you so much.

00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,921
‐Congratulations, Sharmi.
‐Yay!

00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:07,725
Thank you.
You sold it!

00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:08,960
‐Well done, kids.
‐Thank you, guys.

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,294
‐Congratulations.
‐Bye‐bye.

00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:12,363
‐Thank you.
‐Thank you.

00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,899
A deal with Daymond means
that we've got

00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,068
a fantastic
licensing opportunity,

00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,737
and that allows us
to get all girls coding.

00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,407
He knows the toy business, and
we could do so much together,

00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:24,042
and this is great.

00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,777
I mean, I can't believe
I got a deal. Yay!
