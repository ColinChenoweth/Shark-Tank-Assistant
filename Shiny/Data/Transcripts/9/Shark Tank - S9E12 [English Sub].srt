on Wall Street.

I stuck it out for six years,
and I hated it.

the courage to quit

and become a comedy writer.

00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:56,029
And Hater was originally
a comedy‐sketch idea that I had.

00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,064

the more I thought,

00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,566
"I actually think
there's a demand for this.

00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,967
I think people would use this

if we could make a product

So, up until this point,
I have not paid myself a salary.

00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,982
I liquidated my 401(k).

00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,884

we're now at $4 million.

I'm sure
now that you're tapped in,

00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,423
we can all agree that drinking
fresh, right from the source

00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,326
is the best way
to relax and hydrate.

00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,062
You know, we've all seen some
crazy ways to open a coconut.

00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,565
Banging! And hammering!
And chopping!

00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,066

pitched right here
in the Tank.

00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,104
But what we've created

00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:16,209
is the only 100% made in USA
coconut water system.

00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,278
It allows you to quickly
and safely tap a coconut.

00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,514
Let me just show you
how it works.

00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,349
You take the Coco Tapper,

00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,084
you remove the safety cover,

00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,054
and you make a hole right
in the coconut like so.

00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,256
Now, once a hole
is in the coconut,

00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,559
you take the Coco Tap and you
thread it in counterclockwise.

00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,095
Now, the end of the Coco Tapper
is like a wrench.

00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,031
And you just tighten it on
like so.

00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,968
Now, once the tap is secured
into the coconut,

00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,503
it's fully re‐sealable.

00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,372
Our lab results show
that the fresh‐tapped coconut

00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,075
will last up to four weeks
in the refrigerator.

00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:51,244
Now, Sharks, our mission

00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:55,348
is to get everyone tapped in to
this ultimate vacation beverage.

00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,583
All you got to do is say,
"Yes!"

and we'll start bringing in

and we have the branded

what are you selling it for?

$45 per case right now.

00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,719

do you typically deliver

00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,254
to a resort at one time?

00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,356
A minimum order
is 5 to 10 cases.

00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:14,560
So you're making $90 or $180
per customer per delivery.

00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,263
Yes, sir.

00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,998

I‐I‐I started solving problems
when I'm really young.

Really, I was a fat kid
in the very beginning.

00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,580
I was challenged
with my weight.

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,550
And I overcame that.
I lost 75 pounds.

00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,285
‐Good for you. Congrats.
‐Good for you.

00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,787
So, basically, an Indonesian
friend of mine said, "Try this,"

00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,723
and I was like,
"I don't like coconut water,"

00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:44,857
and he said, "Just try it."

00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,126
Once I was tapped in,
it was over.

00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,829
Hammer and knife every time
after my workouts.

00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,564
I broke my stepdad's knife.

00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:52,898
I said, "We got to fix this."

00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,567
So I made the coconut
re‐sealable,

00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,935
created the tool kit.

with the logistics of delivery.

How do you scale that?

00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:23,062

a $25 billion market,

00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:12,157
to be simple, convenient,
and useful for you.

00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:15,427
I started EverlyWell because
I had a really common problem.

00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,762
I spent months

00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,265
trying to figure out
a very basic hormone imbalance.

00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:22,301
I went to a lot of doctors
who ran a lot of tests,

00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,903
which took a lot of time

00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,206
and cost me a lot of money
in unexpected lab bills.

00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:30,809
All I received was a bunch
of this paper with numbers,

00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,914
which I spent weeks researching
on my own with no help.

00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,549
I thought there had to be
a better way.

00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,985
And that's why we built
EverlyWell.

00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,856

With the Vitamin D test, it is a

About half of our tests
require a small finger prick.

Half of them don't.

00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,808
How do I get the test?
I go to your website.

00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,944
So, currently,
we have 13 different tests,

00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,979
all available
only on our website today.

00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,347

00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,850
They range from anywhere
from $69 to $399.

00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,586
How much cheaper is that
than going to the doctor?

00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:22,287
It's generally cheaper
to use our tests.

‐By 10%, 50%?

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,026

So, Julia,
it's not covered by insurance.

00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,529
Today we entered the market

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,598

We are not in network
with insurance providers yet.

So what you're really selling to
me ‐‐ It's really convenience.

00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,472
I can get the test done quickly.
I don't have to go anywhere.

00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,808
Our customers tell us
the value proposition is access,

00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:43,809
not just convenience.

00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,344
The reason
we started the product

00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,980
is 'cause people cannot actually
get these tests on their own.

00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,082
They also aren't able to know
the price of the test

00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,651
before they go to the lab
to the get blood taken

00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,053
or provide a saliva sample.

00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,287
They get hit with a lab bill.

00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,256
Have you proven this out?
Do you have revenue?

00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:58,724
Do you have consumers?

00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,526
We launched

00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:03,896
In less than a year, we have

Wow.
And we're on
a $400,000‐a‐month run rate.

00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,735
We've grown 20% on average

‐Good for you.
‐That's very good.

00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,905
And you're projected
to do what?

00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,707
So, the forecast today
is $5 million, $5.5 million

00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,242
based on our online business

00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,379
without the genomics launch
next month, which is happening.

00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:22,881

Yes.

00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:23,782
Next year?

00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:24,616
$12.3 million.

00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,118
So we do expect next year

00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:29,021
to be able to double through
the genomics combined products.

Actually, I come from
a fairly traditional background.

00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,061
I grew up in Dallas.

00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,497
Got, actually, a full academic
scholarship to Vanderbilt.

00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:39,865
‐Wow.
‐Graduated early

00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,167
with a double major in econ
and psychology.

00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,469
Ended up in consulting

00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,737
and actually went back
to get my MBA from Harvard,

00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,673
where I graduated top 5% there,
as well.

00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,441
‐That makes sense.
‐Wow.

You're not a doctor, Julia,

I'm not a doctor.

00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,212
You must have raised
a lot of money.

00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,980
I raised $5 million to date.

00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,915
‐Wow.
‐At what valuation?

00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,284
The last round
was the convertible note

00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,552
at a $15 million cap.

00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,154
What's your burn rate today,
Julia?

00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,323
Our burn rate right now
is about $150,000 a month.

00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,791
You're losing money today
on this.

00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:06,792
We are losing money,

00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:07,993
but it's 'cause
we're investing

00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,428
for building
additional features.

00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:12,364
If we were to cut down
the head count and say, "Okay,

00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,899
are we just gonna grow
organically?"

00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,534
we could do that
with our margins today.

00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,236
It's just not
where we want to go.

00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,471
Now, we do have one test
that we just launched,

00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,241
which is already 10% of our
business, which is our STD test.

00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:24,276
‐I was gonna ask you that.
‐You're missing STD

00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,777
in a big way there.
‐I'm like...

00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,646
That, honestly, will end up
being your number‐one seller.

00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,516
Is there online competitors
like you?

00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:31,817
There is no online competitor

00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,485
doing a platform
of at‐home kits.

00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,021
What about a company
like 23andMe?

00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,823
Could they just not pivot?

00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,258
What's the competitive
advantage?

00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,927
We believe our competitive
advantage is the platform.

00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:45,430
Of our six labs, we can actually
roll out 250 different tests,

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,567
and next month, we are launching
a partnership with Helix

00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,569
to actually bring in
genomics products.

00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,572
So you can get
any type of health data,

00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,507
whether it's genetic,
whether it's lab,

00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,076
and add it into the system.
So there are people that'll give
you certain specific tests,

00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,445
but you're doing
the entire range of them.
Exactly. Right.

00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,648
Are you looking to sell
to something like 23andMe?

00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,616
And what's your goal?
‐So, yeah, so, our ‐‐

00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,919
our customers are 75% women,

00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,454
and ‐‐ and really,
women are going to be ‐‐

00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,223
They're 80% of the
healthcare decision makers.

00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,991
‐75% are women?
‐It was higher.

00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,394
It was 85% before
we launched our STD product.

00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,962
Because women
are managing everything.

00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:18,730
They're the ones
that need to save the time.

00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,967
And to the exit question,
this is a really hot space.

00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:25,037
There is a lot of opportunity
both for acquisition

00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,573
from either traditional
diagnostics companies

00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,742
or from genomics companies.
Julia, your challenge
is competition.

00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:34,112
It is a race right now. It's
gonna take a lot more money.

00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,748
There's gonna be a ton
of competition in this space.

00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,650
And for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,785
Okay.

00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,853
I think what scares me
about your business

00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,722
is I think it's gonna take
constant re‐development,

00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,123
and you're gonna need
a lot of money

00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,258
that I'm not wiling
to give.

00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,760
So I'm out.

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,296
The cost of doing business
in America

00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:55,701
for employees on healthcare
is astounding.
Mm‐hmm.

00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:58,937
When I compare it to my UK costs
or my Canadian costs...
Mm‐hmm.

00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,439
...it's unbelievable.

00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,742
Four, five times as much
on a per‐employee basis.

00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,746
As Mark said, it's a race.
And you got to raise more money.

00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,948
It's not for me.
I'm out.

00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,149
Okay.

00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,618
I've seen a number
of presentations.

00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,286
I have to say yours
is probably right there

00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,021
at the top
in terms of poise...
Thank you.

00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,557
...intellect,
sophistication.

00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:23,061
I also think that taking charge
of your personal health...
Mm‐hmm.

00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,364
...is a massive trend because
we want to know what's going on,

00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:27,332
but you don't want to go
to the hospital.
Right.

00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,534
But this is
a highly expensive game.

00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:33,872
I think the $1 million that ‐‐
that I'm happy to give you

00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,540
would be diluted rapidly

00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,577
because this is gonna take
tens of millions

00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:39,878
to get
to the promised land.

00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:44,516
So for that reason,
unfortunately, I'm out.

00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:48,020
I think the product
is brilliantly crafted.

00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,988
‐Thank you.
‐It's really nice.

00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,457
It's really easy.
It's super‐clear.

00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,427
I think the state of healthcare
in our country right now

00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,795
is so precarious.

00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,232
Millions right now
are out of insurance...
Yes.

00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,700
...or fearing
that they will be.

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,603
And I think that this gives
people an empowered way

00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,104
at least to check
on some things

00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,340
to know whether or not
they have to go find a doctor.

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,275
And I totally get
the woman thing.

00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,277
I would like to take
a flier on you.

00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,746
So I'm gonna be
a little creative here.
Cheek: Okay.

00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:18,717
How about I give you
a $1 million line of credit,

00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:22,287
8% interest for the 5%.

00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,090
And then I'll bring
all the marketing savvy

00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,360
and the retail and everything
that I know I can do.

00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,596
We actually desperately
need a line of credit.

00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:32,864
‐Oh!
‐As you know,

00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,900
our inventory
isn't very expensive,

00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,836
and we don't have enough history
to have collateral from a bank.

00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,805
And so while I didn't bring that
up today,

00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:41,873
it was something that
I'm very interested in.

00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,710
‐So I read your mind.
‐You did.

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,411
Well, then...?

00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,715
So, I know that I'm technically
supposed to counter.

00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,616
But I...
‐You're allowed to say yes.

00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,985
But I would love to do a deal
with you, Lori...

00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,654
‐Whoo!

Lori has the knowledge
of how to think about branding.

00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,744
We have a great team
of investors,

00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,246
but there's something about
being able to understand

00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,949
how to sell products to our
consumer base, which is women.

00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,051
And she's gonna be
so helpful in doing that.

00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,753
‐Let's just take this example.
‐This could be huge.

00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,088
Let's say you're in college.
You're sexually active.

00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,590
Just for that test alone,

00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,158
think how many students
and young people and whatever

00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,860
it would help out.
Just college campuses.
I agree with you.

00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,495
It's huge.
Unmarried people
it would help out.

Hi, Sharks.
I'm Ashley Thompson.

And I'm Kat Thomas.

00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,921
We're the creators of Mush
out of San Diego, California.

00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,156
And we're here on a mission

00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,158
to combat America's
love affair with sugar.

00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:09,227
We're here to offer you a
10% equity stake in our company

00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,363
in exchange for $300,000.

00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:13,965
So, when Ashley and I first
entered the workforce

00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,267
in the world of finance,

00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,602
we quickly realized
how genuinely hard it is

00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,338
to find foods that are healthy
as well as convenient.

00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:23,275
As you Sharks know,
most on‐the‐go breakfast foods

00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,044
and snacks like yogurt,
protein bars, cereal ‐‐

00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,647
They're all completely laden
with sugar

00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,682
and other
processed garbage.

00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,151
That's why we created
this bad boy ‐‐ Mush.

00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:37,823
First to market, all natural,
100% ready‐to‐eat oatmeal.

00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,791
Now, the really cool thing
about this product

00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,193
is it's never
actually cooked.

00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,028
What we do
is we cold‐soak the oats

00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,930
in house‐made almond
or coconut milk.

00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,964
Resulting product

00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,933
has a beautiful consistency
of a pudding,

00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,869
is just as easy to digest
as traditional oatmeal,

00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,404
but it's
more nutrient‐dense.

00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:55,240
We haven't cooked off all those
awesome vitamins and minerals.

00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,744
Mush is also dairy‐free,
protein‐rich, high in fiber,

00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,380
and it's served
conveniently cold

00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,349

single‐serving pods

00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,117

from right to left.

On your right,
you'll see vanilla bean.

That's the original flavor.

00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:50,695
What we have there
is a rolled oat

00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,531
soaked in
our house‐made almond milk.

00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,866
We then add
an organic vanilla bean.
Oh, wow!

00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,502
Sweeten it with a degla date
out of Coachella, California,

00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,004
a touch of sea salt,
and that's it.

00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,272
Exactly.
‐All right, dark? They're ‐‐

00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:03,241
Dark cacao.
It's an organic cacao powder.

‐Michigan blueberry.

We use a wild blueberry
out of Michigan.

is a cold brew.

‐Okay, great.

So, we started the company
two years ago.

Our first year we just sold
the product at farmers markets

00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,815
to get feedback.

00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,685
We did $70,000 in sales
our first year.

00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:49,955
This year
we've done $120,000.

00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:53,158
We've launched in Whole Foods
in March.

00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,626
And the number
for next year?

00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:58,029
We're set to make $900,000
for the year.

00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,432
‐Wow!
‐All right,

00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,834
what do you make it for?
What does it retail for?
Sure.

00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,669
So,
depending on the flavor,

00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,938
we make it
for about 70 to 80 cents.

00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,140
What's the retail?
The retail's $3.99.

00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,609
Your margins are terrific.

00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,911
But your price point
seems out of whack

00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,879
with some of the competitors
that I've seen out there.

00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,381
‐Okay.
‐I disagree.

00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:18,650
I don't ‐‐ I don't think
the price point's too high.
Okay.

00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,051
I think for the value
you provide,

00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,219
the convenience you provide,

00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,687
the challenge
is where you're selling it.

00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,490
If you're completely dependent
on grocery stores,

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,225
then he's right ‐‐
You have to be concerned.

00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,194
But you have
such a convenience factor

00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:31,663
and the fact that Amazon
is taking over the world,

00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:34,265
I mean, there's a reason
why Amazon bought Whole Foods.

00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:38,203
Jeff Bezos believes that pricing
and speed of delivery

00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:40,372
are the two things that will
never go out of style,

00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:44,843
and so his goal is that
they can get groceries to you

00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,645
faster than you can
get in the car

00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,546
and go to the grocery store
and back.

00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,116
Where Mark is wrong is that
price point does matter

00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,717
'cause there's a price point
that's been set ‐‐
When you're in a case ‐‐

00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,919
When you're in a case
next to your competition.
But even online,

00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,622
yogurts have set a price point,
whether we like it or not.

00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,058
They're $1.99.

00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:02,394
Can I throw out a random idea?
‐Sure.

00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,496
I think that,
just very tactical,

00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,264
you might have
too big of baggage.

00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,932
There might be
too much in here.

00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,568
I think you can drop
cost of goods...
Thompson: Sure.

00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,771
...and then it also bridges
the snack realm...

00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,572
Sure.
...where I'm not
fully making this a meal.

00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,142
‐Yes.
‐Tell us about you.

00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:20,412
What's your background?
How do you know each other?

00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,947
So, I got a job at Goldman
in London.

00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,649
When I looked around
the trading floor

00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,785
and I looked at the very few
women that there were

00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,386
and I really
didn't find anyone

00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,455
that I would aspire to be
one day.
Mm.

00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:33,725
And so I was like, "Okay,
this maybe isn't the best fit."

00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:36,127
Ashley, tell me about you.

00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,263
So, I went to school
in New York City,

00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:39,564
graduated in three years

00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,766
with a mathematics
and economics degree,

00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,568
and then went on
to Goldman.

00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:47,605
‐Did you like that job?
‐Unlike Kat, I loved my job.

00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:51,976
All right, how did you come up
with the Mush thing together?

00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,244
So, we were
just, like, talking,

00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,846
kind of bouncing ideas
off of one another,

00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:56,781
and I was like, "Yeah,
I'm itching to do something,

00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,283
but we don't really know
what to do."

00:36:58,283 --> 00:36:59,818
And the one thing
that we connected on

00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,020
was how hard it was to fuel
ourselves at the desk.
Hmm.

00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,489
And so we quit our jobs
and moved to San Diego.

00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,191
‐And got to work.
‐And then we got to work.

00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:09,627
So, guys, I love the mission.
I love your purpose.

00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,329
But I hate the food business

00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,531
because it requires
so much money.

00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,766
Not for me. I'm out.

00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,067
‐Well, we appreciate that.
‐Thank you so much.

00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,235
Thanks so much.

00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,938
So, ladies,
I respect my venerable Sharks.

00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,339
Don't get me wrong.

00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:27,378
But none of them have been
part of building $4 billion...

00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,180
Cuban: But there's one exception
to that, right?
...consumer
food‐beverage company.

00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,715
‐Let him talk.
‐Well, no, no, no.

00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,550
‐You're mischaracterizing.
‐Let him talk.

00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,753
He'll be
the first to admit.
That's not a fair thing
to say at all.

00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,354
It's okay.
Let him speak.

00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,456
No, it's not a fair thing
to say.
No, 'cause
there's a difference

00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,657
between
being an entrepreneur

00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,992
and having been
through the grind

00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,594
and having had your back
against the wall

00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,530
versus walking in and saying,
"50 Cent, here's $10 million

00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,267
and equity in a company
that I don't own."

00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,771
Just so we understand here,
I've never been an entrepreneur.

00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,272
Mark's right.

00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,007
What I have done

00:37:56,007 --> 00:38:00,712
is found brilliant founders
with amazing products

00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:04,883
and turned them into
multi‐billion‐dollar exits.

00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,218
You don't need another
entrepreneur.

00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,821
You need someone
with ideas.

00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:12,157
And I disagree with Mark.
Isn't that the same thing?

00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,125
No, Mark.

00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,628
I agree with Mark.
Amazon is the way of the future.

00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,029
But today this is not
gonna fly off on Amazon.

00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,631
No, that's not what I said,
though.
You've got to get ‐‐

00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,466
That's not what I said.
You've got to get
Whole Foods...

00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,368
What I said
was the world has changed.
Let him finish.
Let him finish.

00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:24,602
You've got to get Whole Foods
nation‐wide.

00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,437
I have that.
‐So do I.

00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,173
You want to get into
traditional grocery?

00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,707
I have that.
‐So do I.

00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,443
You want ideas on how
to build brands? I have that.
So do I.

00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,112
‐So do I.
‐Mark has all of that,

00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:36,581
and he's not got a single food
or beverage company

00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,551
that has exited
over $100 million.
Marketing, connections.

00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,921
And I'll give you six
if you want, and rock and roll.

00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,589
Is there an offer?

00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:47,158
For me, the juice
has to be worth the squeeze.

00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,027
There's got to be enough
equity in this thing,

00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,261
and you'll need more money,

00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,163
so what I want to do
is offer you guys ‐‐

00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,431
instead of $300,000,

00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,967
I'm gonna offer you $400,000
for 20% of the company.

00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,702
Ooh!

00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,537
You guys are brilliant
mathematics people.

00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,106
You worked at Goldman.
It's simply 5%.
Okay,
we're at the point ‐‐

00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,375
‐We're talking about is 5%...
‐Each.

00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,579
...worth getting a decent exit
or getting a mega exit.

00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:11,950
You know, Rohan is genius
with the food industry.

00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,321
He's done SmartWater
and Vitaminwater and popchips.

00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:20,658
He could really blow you up.
So I will step out.

00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,627
Cuban:
Okay, so, wait, wait, wait.

00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:26,130
I'll make you the offer
with $300,000 for 10%,

00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,732
just what you asked for.
‐Wow.

00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,301
And an unlimited credit line.
Whatever you need.

00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,571
Wait, don't answer that.
Don't answer it.

00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,180
Narrator: Two Sharks are out.

00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,282
Kat and Ashley
have two offers

00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:46,818
for their cold oatmeal product,
Mush.

00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:51,155
Rohan has offered $400,000
for a 20% stake.

00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:55,326
Mark's offer is $300,000
for a 10% stake

00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,061
plus
an unlimited credit line.

00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,398
What do you guys say?
Wait, don't answer that.

00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,834
Whether you have Mark
or Rohan or I,

00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,236
the entire future
of your business is dependent

00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,106
on the strength of the people
you choose from the get‐go.

00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,375
You fit my team
of entrepreneurs perfectly.

00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,577
You're cut out of the same cloth
as my winners.

00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,912
Here's my offer.

00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:18,483
I'll give you the $300,000 cash
for 10% of the business.

00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,551
I'll give you whatever credit
lines you need

00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,253
'cause the food space
is expensive.

00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,890
So, guys,
what are you gonna do?

00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,592
Cuban:
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,560
Let me just give one more
example.

00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,429
My company
Alyssa's Healthy Cookies.

00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,098
Same ‐‐ Same concept,
same approach ‐‐ no sugar.

00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,533
Very similar to you.
‐How big is that market?

00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,402
‐$8 million in sales.
‐$8 million.

00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:38,770
$4 million in profits.

00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,705
Chef's Cut is my smallest one ‐‐
$60 million.

00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:41,873
No, but the difference is,
right,

00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,308
how much money do they make?
‐Chef's?

00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:44,742
They're about 5 million bucks
a year.

00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,744
‐Okay, so, that company ‐‐
‐Valuation's over $200 million.

00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,146
So, how about your biggest ‐‐
popchips?

00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:49,380
Valuation
is all that matters.

00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,182
No, the valuation only matters
if you plan on selling.

00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,483
They want
to change the world.

00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,152
Do you plan on selling
this company at some point?

00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,720
No, we want
to change the world.
Change the world.

00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:01,559
All right.
So my partner Doug makes
$4 million in profits a year,

00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,861
and he's just putting
all this in his pocket.

00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,097
We've gotten offers.
We've turned them down.

00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,899
Now, I've pushed Doug
to scale more.

00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,401
Doug doesn't want to go any
faster than he wants to go.

00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,270
You guys could have done that
in your sleep.

00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,373
Can we make this popchips
or Vitaminwater?

00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,908
Or can we make it
Alyssa's Cookies.

00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,476
That's the difference.
You know what,
he's exactly right.

00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,411
He's exactly right.
‐You want to make a br‐‐

00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,614
Because his beef jerky
company ‐‐
You want to make it
a mega brand across America.

00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,717
That's what changes the world,
if you want to change the world.

00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:27,719
Yeah, popchips changed the world
in ways we can't imagine.
[ Laughter ]

00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,854
‐Distribution ‐‐
‐This is what I do for a living.

00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:34,692
If you want to do enterprise
software, he's your guy.
Rohan, you're gonna have
a heart attack.

00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,094
Herjavec:
What are you gonna do?

00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,532
They're all, honestly,
unbelievable offers,

00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:44,335
and we're, like, incredibly
humbled as entrepreneurs.

00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,870
It's, like, honestly
a kid's dream.

00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,776
Mark, we'd love to.

00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:54,312
‐Ay, ay, ay!
‐Aah!

00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,813
‐Thank you so much.
‐Thank you.

00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,849
‐You're so welcome.
‐Thank you for everyone.

00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:04,389
Thompson:
While all of the offers
from the Sharks were amazing,

00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:05,923
we went with Mark because

00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:09,394
we want to change the world
for the better, and so does he.

00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,796
Rohan, you got a little bit
scraped in that one.

00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,498
What did you learn
out of that?

00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,933
Honestly, I felt, given my
expertise in this industry,

00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,368
that...
‐You were worth more than Mark.

00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,770
...my equity should have been
worth more.

00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,039
I think for where they are
and where they want to go,

00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,974
I think he had a better vision
for them.

00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:24,776
I don't disagree.
