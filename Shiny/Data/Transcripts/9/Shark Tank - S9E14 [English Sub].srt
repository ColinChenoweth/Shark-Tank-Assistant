00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,041
‐Yes.
‐It is incredibly heavy.

00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,776
Yes.
How is a woman supposed
to pick this up

00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,244
and put it back
in her car?

00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,847
Okay, first of all, this,

00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,549
it doesn't weigh too much
because it's all aluminum.

00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,284
The weight is here.

00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,486
I understand ‐‐
I understand...

00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,520
Couldn't that
be aluminum, too?

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,721
Like once you make
the real thing?

00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,123
Yes, but, Paolo, how is she
gonna put it in the car,

00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,157
to Kevin's question?

00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,625
Why you have to put it
in the car?

00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,594
Would you put it in a car,
a jogger stroller? No.

00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,795
To go to the park
or whatever.

00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,663
Because I go to the park,
I'm going somewhere else.

00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,266
Well...
I always have to put my jogging
stroller in the car.

00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,069
Okay, but not all the jogger
strollers are foldable.

00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,103
‐Yes, they are.
‐Yeah, they are.

00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,138
Not all of them.

00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,306
Paolo,
what did you do before this?

00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,143
I'm a real estate broker,
and I came into this country

00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,812
with 400 bucks in my pocket.
Guys, no money.

00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,947
Actually, one night,
I was sleeping ‐‐

00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,949
no mattress ‐‐
I was sleeping on the floor,

00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,818
and then I feel like
something here.

00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,553
It was a cockroach.
‐Ew.

00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,723
So what I started doing,
I started working three jobs.

00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,792
Eventually after three,
four years,

00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,795
I was owning three apartments,
and I got into real estate,

00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,697
and I work on this project
only on my spare time.

00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,267
It's interesting that you're
successful in real estate.

00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,501
You take the money
you're making,

00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,936
you put it into this,

00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,906
with the passion
for solving this issue.

00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,507
This is not me
solving an issue.

00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,142
This is creating a brand.

00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,710
There is a need for this.

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,046
Women want this.
If you ‐‐

00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,216
I went to South Pointe Park
in South Beach.

00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,251
We couldn't do,
like, 10 yards

00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,020
without being stopped
by women.

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,588
Okay, Paolo ‐‐
Paolo, look,

00:15:55,588 --> 00:16:01,327
if you had priced this at
$50,000 for 10% and grow, maybe.

00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,929
$500,000.

00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,132
You're right, the company
is not worth $1.25 million,

00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,900
and I understand that,

00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,902
but that's the money
I need to go

00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,571
into production
and make these.

00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,839
‐First, look ‐‐
‐Yes.

00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,674
You don't need money
for production

00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,343
until you have potential
customers, right?

00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,412
I have people
that send me e‐mails

00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,981
that they want to buy it,
but I need to go to testing.

00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,583
There are other steps.

00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,318
I was gonna say,
have you done

00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,586
the safety testing
and all of the tests

00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,020
that you need to do
for child safety stroller?

00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,223
That's why I'm here and that's
why I'm asking ‐‐

00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,424
‐Okay.
‐You haven't done that.

00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,492
No, I have not.

00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,960
Paolo, you put so much
of your energy

00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,328
into getting patents,

00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,863
and this is such
a mature industry

00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,564
with major manufacturers
that already have

00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,066
established distributions.

00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,101
Why haven't you gone to them
and said,

00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,203
"Look, I have these patents.
This is gonna solve a problem.

00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,539
‐License it.
‐License it from me.

00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,674
Sell them for me,
and I'll take a 7% royalty."

00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,743
‐No risk.
‐Because it's easy to say,

00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,946
but I cannot go to...

00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,183
‐Why not?
‐...and go inside the company ‐‐

00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,085
Herjavec: Why?

00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,720
Why can't you
just call them?

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,822
They will license it
if I have a brand.

00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:06,259
You have taken the hard road
to establishing market share

00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,995
in the stroller market.
From scratch.

00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:13,399
It doesn't really make sense
for me to give you $500,000

00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,301
so I can compete
with companies

00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,371
that already have achieved
massive distribution globally,

00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,740
but I don't have to reinvent
that whole business

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,842
to be part of it.
I could just license it.

00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,510
You don't seem to want
to take that path.

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,145
No, I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.

00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,847
You told me you couldn't
even get into their door.

00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,582
Because I can't put too much
meat on the grill.

00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,617
Okay, look, Paolo, for me,
I don't see it, okay?

00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,152
I'm sorry. I'm out.

00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,420
Okay. Okay. Thank you.

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,821
Cuban: Paolo,
it's just too big of a swallow.

00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,690
$500,000 ‐‐

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,359
You know, the risk‐reward
just isn't there for me, Paolo.

00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,761
I'm out.

00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,596
Okay. I understand.
I understand.

00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,431
‐Paolo.
‐Yes, Lori?

00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:51,337
I'm not willing
to risk $500,000.

00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:54,674
So, unfortunately,
I have to be out.

00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,712
You know, you made one
of the most critical mistakes

00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:02,949
that almost all
entrepreneurs do make.

00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:06,319
How did you get to the point
where you had enough money ‐‐

00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,521
$170,000
to invest in this?

00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:09,689
How did you
get to that point?

00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,624
You were sleeping at home
with a roach on you,

00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,858
and then all of a sudden,
you had that type of money?

00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:13,960
Hustling. Hustling.

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,194
‐Hustle, right?
‐Yeah.

00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,996
You didn't have money
when you did it, right?

00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,698
No.
You knock on door
to door to door.

00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,032
Yeah.

00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,668
I made my biggest mistake
when I finally got money.

00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,071
I thought that money
could solve the problem,

00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:29,308
and I spent $6 million trying
to build a brand that failed.

00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,811
You see,
because you had that money,

00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,212
that's why you made
the mistakes.

00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,881
Because before that, you know
what you would have done?

00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,350
You'd have taken
an existing stroller,

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,251
you would have repainted it,
cut the back off of it,

00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,620
and welded
something on there.

00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,954
And then you know
your next step?

00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,991
You go to the ABC show
and all those children shows,

00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:48,527
and just like people stop you
every five feet on the beach,

00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,597
those buyers and manufacturers
and producers

00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,433
will stop you as you're riding
around the show.

00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,668
Money's
not gonna solve it.

00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,236
You're gonna have to go out
and do this on your own.

00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,671
I think you can,
but at this point,

00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,406
I can't give you the money,
so I'm out.

00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,641
Okay. Can I ‐‐

00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:06,212
Paolo, you know,
you are so deeply excited

00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,447
about this and passionate
about it,

00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,082
but you got
to stop designing,

00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,051
you got to stop
getting more patents.

00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:15,421
You have to have
the same level of love

00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:19,258
and passion for the product
in terms of sales!

00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,826
Go sell one.

00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,229
Today, you have crowdfunding,
you have Instagram.

00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,898
There are different ways
to sell stuff today.

00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,933
You don't need ‐‐
‐I don't want just the money.

00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,770
That's the point.
I don't want just the money.

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,338
I want somebody like you ‐‐

00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,240
But you asked
for the wrong amount, Paolo.

00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:41,514
For $500,000,
I can't get on board.

00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,249
I'm out.

00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,884

‐Thank you so very much, guys.

00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:45,918
‐Thank you.
‐Me, too.

00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:46,786
‐Good luck.
‐Goodbye.

00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,121
Bye. Thanks.

00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,428
I understand that maybe asking
for $500,000 was too much,

00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:59,465
but I didn't have anybody
to compare my idea.

00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:02,301
So in my mind,
that was good to ask,

00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,736
you know, for $500,000.

00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,938
Obviously it wasn't.

00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,474

doing that elliptical?

00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,575
Isn't that like
a 10‐minute thing,

00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,876
and then you're
kind of...?

00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,745
No, I do an hour of elliptical
every night.

00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:13,946

00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,632
so you never have
to worry again.

00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,800
Here's how it works.

00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,935
Simply replace
your stove's knobs

00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,403
with our smart knobs,

00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,072
and place this sensor unit
on your ceiling.

00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,742
As soon as you turn on your
stove like you normally do,

00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,443
both units will activate.

00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:55,014
If the sensor detects dangerous
levels of gas, smoke,

00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,816
or inactivity
in the kitchen,

00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,918
it will automatically
turn off your burners

00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,452
so you never
have to worry.

00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:04,990
Also, you can monitor your stove
from our app at any time.

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,394
So just simply tap the button
and it will just rotate off.

00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,029
‐Very cool.
‐So, Sharks,

00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,698
who's ready to help
us get this revolutionary device

00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,034
into every home
and onto every stove

00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,669
so people around the world

00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,405
get the peace of mind
that they deserve?

00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,340
Where are you at in the
development stage? Tell us.

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,542
So, we've had a functional
prototype for several months.

00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,611
We've been making aesthetic
refinements because it's

00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,146
a consumer‐facing product,

00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,215
and also we've been making
technical improvements.

00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:31,083
We launched
a Kickstarter in February.

00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:35,321
We had a goal of $40,000,
and we raised 438% of our goal,

00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,922
so $175,000.

00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,024
‐Wow.
‐That's 694 pre‐orders.

00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,359
Ranjith,
how did you come up with this?

00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,261
How did you invent it?
‐Yeah.

00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,896
So, a few years ago,
Ranjith and I

00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,631
were actually in
a very serious car accident.

00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,867
I broke bones throughout
my entire body,

00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,301
most prominently my hips
and my neck.

00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,369
So I was in a wheelchair
for four months.

00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,470
‐Ouch.
‐Wow.

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,005
At that time,
my mom came to live with me

00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:55,741
just to help me out,
and on more than one occasion,

00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:56,909
she kept leaving
the stove on.

00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,244
After I started
walking again,

00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,912
I had gone for a movie
with my mom.

00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,914
About 20 minutes in,
she turns to me and she goes,

00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,049
"Akshita, I can't remember
if I turned the stove off."

00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,585
I was like, "Oh, gosh!"
So we quickly rushed home.

00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,388
Fortunately, we got back
before a big fire had started,

00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,357
but we had a lot
in smoke damage.

00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,759
So I said,
"Why isn't there a product

00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,394
that makes the stove smart,

00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,497
and why isn't there something
that can just retrofit

00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,798
onto a stove that
you already have?"

00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,600
Ranjith,
can you take that off

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,302
and bring it over her
so I can see it?

00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:26,138
Sure.
The name of the company
is Inir‐v?

00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,039
‐Inirv.
‐Inirv.

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,274
What does it mean?

00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:30,175
So, it comes from the medical
term "to innervate."

00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,111
We both have medical
backgrounds.

00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,713
I graduated from Duke
with a Neuroscience degree.

00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,882
Greiner: Wow.
And I was actually
in the process

00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,785
of applying to medical school
when I came up with this idea,

00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:43,155
and I really saw this space
as ripe for innovation,

00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,091
and so I literally dropped out
of the medical school

00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,560
application process to focus on
this company full‐time.

00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,229
I'll tell you a little bit
about my background.

00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:53,232
So, I'm a resident neurosurgeon,
and I went to ‐‐

00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:55,167
‐You're a resident neurosurgeon?
‐You're both in neurosurgery.

00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,268
‐Yes.
‐Wow.

00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,871
‐Where?
‐I went to college in Atlanta,

00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,906
got my Bachelor's
and Master's in four years.

00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,475
Bachelor's and Master's
in four years?

00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,810
‐Right.
‐What took you so long?

00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,512
I know. I watched a lot of TV,
what can I say?

00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:07,746
"Shark Tank."
‐[ Laughs ]

00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:08,948
Okay, so now ‐‐

00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,083
But this is mostly mechanical,
though, right?

00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,452
Because you're using
off‐the‐shelf sensors.

00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,987
It's not really secret sauce.
‐Yeah.

00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,522
It's not very protectable,

00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,390
and it's got to lead to
something else, right?

00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,960
Well, wait, wait. Why is he
saying it's not protectable?

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,394
Is it protectable?
‐Absolutely.

00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,862
So, we've done
extensive patent search,

00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,731
and we've filed multiple
provisional patents.

00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,566
Herjavec: What's your vision
of going to market with this?

00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,601
Yeah.
Because you haven't sold any
except Kickstarter.

00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,704
What we're
working on now

00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,206
is for you
to pre‐program recipes.

00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,608
So, say you know
that your chicken cooks

00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,911
for 10 minutes on high,
five minutes on low,

00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,512
and then off,
which most recipes

00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,914
are pretty standard
that way.

00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,450
You have to put your chicken
on the stove,

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,685
but then through our app,
you can click that recipe,

00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,820
and it will modulate
the burner temperature for you.

00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,221
Why wouldn't the manufacturer

00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,823
of the large stove
platforms...

00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,491
Thank you for asking
that question.

00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,259
...just hire you as programmers
and do that?

00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,995
Or someone else, frankly.

00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,529
Because if they control
the distribution,

00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,731
they control the device?

00:24:58,731 --> 00:24:59,898
‐Yeah.
‐Yup.

00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,567
So, with this device,
and I realize you've got

00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,502
to have a broader vision
because I frankly think

00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,871
in 36 months,
this will be obsolete.

00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,174
‐What are you talking about?
‐Why are you saying that?

00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,342
No, I agree with him.
I agree with him.

00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,277
This is our entryway
into the kitchen.

00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,679
This is a pain point now.

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,648
I mean, our Kickstarter
we sold because people identify

00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,517
with the fact that they want
that peace of mind,

00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,985
that they can just
turn off their stove.

00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,286
Yeah, but that's only 700
orders,

00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,788
that's not really
indicative, right?
Sure.

00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:24,123
John: Those sales through
Kickstarter ‐‐

00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,592
what was the price
you were selling?

00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:27,860
You sell four knobs?

00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,429
We sold it as a kit
of a sensor and four knobs,

00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,563
and then you can add
additional knobs.

00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,766
‐For how much?
‐If you have more burners.

00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:34,933
And how much was that?

00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,469
And the average order price
was $250.

00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:40,372
Cuban: So this is
a nice‐to‐have product,

00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,376
but the bigger picture is,
this is hard‐sell market

00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,879
because even though
it makes common sense,

00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,180
even though you think people
will have enough

00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,083
self‐interest, they don't.

00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,618
That's why people die,
because they don't have

00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,353
their smoke alarms
or they turn them off

00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:55,320
or take the batteries out.

00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,889
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,027
Whether it's a retrofit
that goes onto the stove

00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:05,664
or we license our technology
to an appliance manufacturer,

00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:06,832
this technology
will be there.

00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,467
I like the long‐term vision.
I get all that.

00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,202
Appliance manufacturers
have approached us already.

00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,371
Who called you?
We're already in discussions
with three of the largest

00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:13,705
appliance manufacturers.
Look, but I have another
question about manufacturers

00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,641
with this product right now.
‐To license?

00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,342
Yeah. To license
and white label it.
Correct.

00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,279
I'll give it a shot. I'll give
you my honest opinion, okay?

00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,282
$800,000.

00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,017
I like money.
That's a lot of it.

00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,119
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐I'd give you $800,000.

00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,122
From what I've heard today,
I see some massive challenges

00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,157
in rolling out
the existing product.

00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:37,162
For me to get back
my $800,000,

00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,964
I fear I'm gonna die
of old age

00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,567
because I'm getting
practically nothing here.

00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,402
So ‐‐
You value this company
at $10 million.

00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,237
You haven't
sold doo‐doo yet.

00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,306
Yeah. Sure.
So let me say first ‐‐

00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,441
‐Hold on. Guys.
‐Yeah.

00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,778
Speak to these Sharks
'cause I am out.

00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:53,745
‐Okay. Appreciate it.
‐Thank you.

00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,147
Thank you for your time.

00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,049
Now, before you tell us
the size of the market

00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,617
or things like that ‐‐
Everybody tells us that,

00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,718
but I hope that's not
what you're doing.

00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:03,422
‐No, no.
‐You know, I like the product.

00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,823
I'd probably get it
for my mother.

00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,625
You asked for $800,000.

00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,796
You would probably
have to sell $200 million

00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,298
worth of products
and we get a distribution

00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,666
for me to even break even.

00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,803
That's with you not
making any mistakes.

00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,539
So ‐‐
I don't think you can do that
within the next three years,

00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,774
and I hope I'm wrong,
but I'm out.

00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,077
‐Okay. Thank you.
‐All right. Appreciate it.

00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,112
So, let me just say something
about the valuation.

00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,715
I know it's high...

00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:32,417
but this is part
of $2 million seed round.

00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,919
I'll take the seed round.

00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,123
But not at 8%.

00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,858
‐Okay.
‐Okay.

00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:43,128
I'll give you the $800,000
for 20%.

00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,230
‐Wow.
‐Oh!

00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,000
Thanks a lot for the offer,
and so I'd love to counter,

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,202
and here is my rationale
before I give you a number.

00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,971
If we stifle our valuation
at this round

00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,507
and give away too much equity,
we're not going to be able

00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,711
to raise a large growth
round and really scale. So...

00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:00,946
No, I respect that,

00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,215
but I guess I have a slightly
different vision.

00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,416
‐Okay.
‐I don't want to build a company

00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,418
that you're constantly
gonna raise money at.

00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,853
‐Okay.
‐Let's build some.

00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,221
‐Sure.
‐Let's sell some.

00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,323
Yes.
And that will increase
the valuation

00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,692
so you have to raise a little

So,
why is your cost so high?

00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:28,093
Number one, we have the best
product on the market,

00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,160
and it's because we spend

00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,196
five times more
than everyone else.

00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:35,333
Number two, we have the best
marketing on the planet.

00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,068
Not if you're spending $13,
right?
Greiner: Wait. Why?

00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,437
Why do you have the best
marketing on the planet?

00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:40,639
‐So.
‐Big statement.

00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,707
When we sell guys,
we approach them

00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,509
by telling them a joke
like he's at a bar.

00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,612
We show him entertainment
and not advertisement.

00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,913
But the bigger
question is ‐‐

00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,650
If my numbers are right,
you're spending about $400,000

00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,118
a year on marketing,
right?

00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,520
We spent about 20%
of net sales.

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,923
So this year,
we'll do $6.3 million in sales,

00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,660
so that means we'll spend
$1.2 million on marketing.

00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,161
You're making my point,
right?

00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,896
If the advertising's good,

00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,131
the less you should
have to spend,

00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:08,400
not the more
because it'd be more viral.

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,301
People would be sharing it
on Facebook more.
Sure.

00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,070
Because that's the whole point
of doing it this way.

00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,271
‐Sure.
‐Right?

00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,540
Your customer acquisition
should be going down,

00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,309
but hopefully the effectiveness
of your ads is going up.

00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,645
Right? So you see that
something's not right.

00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,181
It suggests that the majority
of your videos

00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,417
are not as effective
as you're trying to tell us.

00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,419
Okay, but let's talk about
our competition for a second

00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,454
in one key metric ‐‐
e‐mail marketing channel,

00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,656
which is arguably
the most important.

00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:35,960
The average open rate
amongst our competition is 4%.

00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,662
‐What's yours?
‐40%.

00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:38,797
‐No way.
‐No, no.

00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,932
‐40%.
‐No, that's a false statement.

00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,033
‐No way!
‐40%!

00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,134
‐40%!
‐You lie!

00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,769
Not only is it 40%...
[ Laughter ]

00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,404
half of the guys that open it,
forward it.

00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,772
My question is ‐‐

00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,442
For you to drive sales,

00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:53,344
you're driving the cost
of marketing like crazy.

00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,747
So to get to $12 million
in sales,

00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,615
you're gonna have to spend,
what,

00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,551
$2.6 million on marketing.

00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,286
‐Well, not exactly.
‐Not necessarily.

00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,688
So, first off,
we are 10 times better

00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,190
than everyone else
selling clothes to guys.

00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,891
You can't keep on saying that!

00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,660
‐Why? Why do you say that?
‐Wait, wait, wait.

00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,562
Herjavec: Peter, have you raised
any money from VCs

00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,863
in these last three years?

00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:12,831
I have raised money over
the last three years.

00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,265
‐Oh, you have?
‐What valuation?

00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:18,903
Yeah.
I've raised $560,000
from our friends.

00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,674
We sold at a valuation between
$3 million and $9 million.

00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:25,610
So at this point,
we've sold 11% of the company

00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,146
for $560,000
in outside capital.

00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:29,581
You walk in the door here
and tell me

00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,882
you're worth $16 million.
‐Sure.

00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,485
‐You're crazy.
‐And you're offering me 1.5%.

00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,553
Do you think I'd actually
get up in the morning

00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:36,688
and think of you
if I own 1.5%?

00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:37,789
No,
that's their whole point.

00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,491
‐So, look ‐‐
‐[ Laughs ]

00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,993
Typically,
companies come in here

00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,361
and they have a flaw
in their product

00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,563
or a tweak in their marketing
or they're in the mud

00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,998
and they need to get out
and scale,

00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,933
but we got the product
and the marketing right,

00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,336
we got through the mud.
What I'm asking is ‐‐

00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:53,171
We need a shark
in our corner right now.

00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,106
‐Why?
‐Because my friends

00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,975
don't have the financial
wherewithal

00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,077
to continue to find
our exponential growth.

00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,779
But you're gonna make
$1.3 million.
Greiner: You know what,
honestly...

00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,380
Guys, how much cash do you have
in the bank?

00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,982
So, right now,
we have about $600,000.

00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:05,450
How much do you have in
inventory?

00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,654
So, this single‐biggest problem
we have is 1/3 of the time,

00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,156
we have no inventory.

00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:12,657
But you have $600,000
in the bank.

00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:13,758
What's your lead time?

00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,326
Six months.
So put yourself in my shoes.

00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,695
Six months?
You have a six‐month lead time
to make your shorts?

00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:18,997
You're so full of [bleep] though

00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:21,032
and everything you guys
are saying.

00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,743
Narrator: All Sharks
are still in,

00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:34,345
but there are skeptical
about Chris and Peter's answers

00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,749
regarding their men's shorts
company, birddogs.

00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,250
Your investment
in your inventory

00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,220
really tells me
what you think you can sell.

00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,956
If you're the best
at everything,

00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,758
how can you not
be planning ahead

00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,860
to have inventory
constantly coming in?

00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,461
Why would you have $600,000
in the bank?

00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,130
‐Because you'd be ordering ‐‐
‐Great point.

00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,299
Even if they had the money,
if they had the advertising ‐‐

00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,835
All this work
that you're doing...
Yep.

00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,305
So, Lori ‐‐
...you would be absolutely
having orders go in every month.

00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:02,140
You would never run out
of inventory.
Exactly.

00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,975
So, this is the biggest
problem we have.

00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,744
It takes us six months
from the time we order

00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,046
until the time
the shorts arrive.

00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,714
Six months from now,
we'll be doing about

00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,883
$3 million
in monthly sales,

00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:14,719
which means I need $1 million
in cash to pay

00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,221
for the inventory in six months.
Now, six months from now ‐‐

00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:19,557
You know what, you're
bird‐dogging the answers always.

00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,092
I'm out.
‐Hold on. Right ‐‐

00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,595
‐Ooh.
‐One second.

00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:24,829
Right now,
I've got to make a decision

00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,331
every time
I make an order.

00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,367
‐Your numbers aren't adding up.
‐Do I shoot beyond our demand

00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,603
and risk potentially putting
the company out of business?

00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:33,905
No! What you're saying
makes no sense.

00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,274
Well ‐‐
And I'm surprised
you don't understand

00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,276
that what you're saying
makes no sense.

00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,845
How doesn't it make sense?
O'Leary: Guys, let's stop
for a second and ask a question.

00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,513
‐Sure.
‐How do you think it's going?

00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,215
Uh, I don't know,
I mean...

00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,318
I actually think if we can get
serious for a moment,

00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,520
a lot of the Sharks
think you're full of B. S.,

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,022
and that's a problem here.

00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:53,524
I know! The number
are too good ‐‐ Listen...

00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,460
‐Too good to be true.
‐No, no, no, no, no.

00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,528
They're not ‐‐
No, no, no, no, no, no. No.
You were going
to say that, right?

00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:58,963
‐But, look ‐‐
‐But they're true!

00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,299
I'm gonna make it simple,
Harvard Business School simple.

00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:04,202
If you expect your sales
to more than double...
Mm‐hmm.

00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,170
...in the current year,
that means all your cash

00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,673
should already be gone
if you truly believed that.

00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,542
Well, Mark, good point, except
we're a seasonal business.

00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,511
You have the world's
best marketing!

00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,581
Your sales are going through
the roof! You can't keep up!

00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,917
Everybody else,
you're disrupting
the hell out of them

00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,351
because they don't understand
the millennial market?

00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,719
So you're saying why
don't we just turn

00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,554
the marketing machine up more?
‐I sense some skepticism.

00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,256
You know what, why aren't
you just ordering ‐‐

00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,191
Guys, either you believe
or you don't believe.

00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:30,094
Brands grow at a certain rate,
all right? Meaning...

00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,362
[ Laughing ]
Now you're dialing back!

00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,997
‐Hold on a sec here.
‐Wait a minute.

00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:34,766
You know, we're learning so much
from you, it's amazing.
[ Laughs ]

00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,768
Greiner: Because you're saying
one thing on one side,
and then another thing ‐‐

00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,836
Thank you!
I never thought of that.

00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,039
Why aren't you buying
the inventory now?

00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,273
Because they don't believe.

00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,242
It's not a matter of belief,
it's a matter of risk.

00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:45,677
Isn't that the definition
of risk?

00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,145
How much do you believe?
‐It is, but there's risk

00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:48,212
and then there's
smart risk.

00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,681
Look,
if you were a true birddog,

00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,683
and you were willing to put all
those beers in your pocket,

00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,751
you would say,
"I got this." Right?

00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,520
And the money's in there
because we're all in.

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,722
That would be confident,
but it might be foolish

00:40:57,722 --> 00:40:59,023
because if I over‐order
on inventory...

00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,625
You couldn't come out here
any more arrogant

00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,093
or confident than you did.

00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,163
I'm out.

00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,867
The more you talk,
the more present it,

00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:13,004
the more unclear
the story became.

00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,706
I'm out.

00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,776
Daymond is
the clothing guy.

00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,646
‐So, yeah, um....
‐What are you gonna do?

00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,414
It seems like you were
teaching us business.

00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,516
You were also telling
us about how

00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,585
you're better
than everybody else.

00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,754
So you shouldn't be talking
about other people like that.

00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,055
I think it's a very elitist
attitude,

00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,190
and I just wouldn't be able
to work with you.

00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,758
So I'm out.

00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,527
O'Leary: Okay, guys.

00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,396
In all seriousness,
what happened here today

00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:41,032
is you have $6 million in sales
this year.

00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,735
That would normally get
a lot of interest here.

00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,470
But you're arrogant.

00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,971
You're paying the price for it,

00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,941
and I don't think anybody
wants to work with you.

00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:52,710
It's not funny, it's true.
I'm out.

00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,412
And you are dead to me.
Get out of here.

00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:55,513
‐All right.
‐Good luck, guys.

00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,315
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,686
Wow,
that went sideways fast.

00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,388
What a couple of [bleep]

00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:05,423
‐They were arrogant as hell!
‐Totally arrogant.

00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,158
Greiner:
They thought everything they did
was the best of the best.

00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:09,560
‐They made Kevin look bad.
‐"The best! The best!"

00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,396
They were the best until
they had to put their money

00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:14,599
where their mouth was
and invest in inventory.

00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,067
Mason: I felt like it was
a little bit

00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:17,802
of almost bullying
just to bully.

00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,270
We have
an incredible product.

00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,406
It's 10 times better than
anything else in the market.

00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:23,107
We're growing
like gangbusters.

00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,942
We've managed to do it
profitably.

00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,044
