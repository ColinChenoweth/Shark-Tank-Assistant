00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,186
you love this ‐‐
Greiner: Yeah. Okay.

00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,988
She asked for the problem,
I'm gonna tell her the problem.

00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,224
The problem was we would bring
a bunch of kids out

00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,458
after church on the water,

00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,227
and we wanted them
to be successful.

00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,129
Right.
And they couldn't ride
anything.

00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,398
Okay. That's good.
I'm getting the problem.

00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,400
We felt terrible,
so we sat down,

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,969
we flipped over our napkins,
started drawing some ideas,

00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,404
went straight to the garage,

00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,272
grabbed a piece of wood,
cut it out.

00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,107
In 10 minutes,
we're on the water.

00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,308
We failed.

00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,810
The next day
we did it again.

00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,212
The third day
we're like, "Whoa."

00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,347
The people at the marina

00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,183
that thought we were crazy
are going, "Wow."

00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,086
Now, fast forward,
we've put this on the boat ‐‐

00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,422
This is what they want to ride
all the time.

00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:52,191
So, Glen,
why haven't you sold more?

00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,295
Guys, I've never heard
a disrupter call themselves

00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,532
or their products or their
services "disruptive," right?

00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,833
Disrupters go and disrupt,

00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,435
and the market tells them
they're disruptive.

00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,370
And I think he has been called
a "Disrupter,"

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,304
and that's why
he's saying that.

00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,338
Well, but ‐‐
but the point is it's ‐‐

00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,240
it's more of the deflection

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,243
rather than an answer.

00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,512
I'm out.

00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,880
Thank you.

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,783
Okay. I can't even see us
having a conversation.

00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,985
I'm out.

00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,053
Th‐Thank you,
Daymond.
We appreciate that.

00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,121
Thank you.
‐All right. But, you guys,

00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,823
I want to go back
to the product itself.

00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,491
Sure.
Is there competition?

00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,826
Parks: So, there have been
knock‐offs.

00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,728
Um, there was one
in particular

00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,430
that we believe
seriously violated our claims,

00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,365
but it's a large brand
who wanted

00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,467
to seize the opportunity,

00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,469
so we actually
have found lawyers

00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,971
on 100% contingency...
That's lucky.

00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,473
...pursing that litigation
so that we can focus

00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,108
on the business
'cause, honestly,

00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,676
we are not interested
in litigating.

00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,677
I want to go back
to what matters ‐‐ the numbers.

00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:45,711
‐Yes.
‐The numbers.

00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:46,712
The last number ‐‐
Excuse me, Lori.

00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:47,947
This ‐‐ this matters.

00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:48,948
All right, and before he goes
to the numbers,

00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,116
I want to finish
on the patent thing,

00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,217
'cause I don't want
to beat a dead horse.

00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,651
Enough with the patent.
If they have no sales,

00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,553
who gives a ‐‐
No, I have one last question
that matters.

00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,722
Yes?
So you got
into litigation.

00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,857
Correct.
Did you win?

00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,459
Uh, there was
a summary judgment issued.

00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,794
Uh ‐‐
‐What was the decision?

00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:04,430
It was not in our favor.

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,499
You don't think
that was relevant?

00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,601
No, it ‐‐ it was.
I was trying to talk, and ‐‐

00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,002
‐Right.
‐So, unfortunately,

00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,370
you have to continue on
with your ‐‐

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,072
‐We do, but ‐‐ but ‐‐
‐Fortunately, we'll continue

00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:14,974
in front
of three patent judges,

00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:18,110
not a local guy
that doesn't know patent law.

00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,445
I understand
your patent issues.
Yeah.

00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,746
I understand
the litigation.

00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,149
I want to ask you
about the numbers.
Okay.

00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,483
You told me you were gonna do
a million in sales.

00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,684
Yes, sir.
Okay.

00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,453
What are you gonna make
on that million this year?

00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,088
If we had
a‐a million dollars in sales,

00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:32,458
we will likely, uh,
net $200,000 in net profit.

00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,093
20%
without paying yourselves.

00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,027
Without paying ourselves.

00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,428
Okay,
do you have any debt?

00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,830
We do have debt.
Again, uh ‐‐

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,732
How much debt
do you have?

00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,066
$550,000 in debt.

00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,134
‐Whoa!
‐Ohh.

00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,436
But collateralized
by inventory.

00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,471
‐High inventory.
‐We have a lot of inventory.

00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,639
This year's supposed
to be a windfall.

00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,773
It really is a turning point
for the business.

00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,841
How much cash in the bank
do you have?

00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,442
$100,000 in the bank
right now.

00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,878
We've got $200,000 in ‐‐
in receivables.

00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,046
Yeah, over $200,000.

00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,514
Hey, guys ‐‐ Guys, I got
to tell you something.

00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,582
If you don't have a good season,
you're going to zero.

00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:57,950
You know that?

00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,351
The story's not pretty.

00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,954
It's getting a little uglier
the more I ask

00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,856
about the balance sheet,
okay?

00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,358
I did two seconds worth
of analysis ‐‐

00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,361
You have to monetize
your inventory, like, now.

00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,863
Which is what is
happening right now.

00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:15,201
Well, I hope so, but you are
a 50‐50 chance away from zero.

to present to you.

to invest ‐‐

right?

00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,279
I'm either all in
or I fold.

00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,948
I'm looking at
what you guys have.

00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,549
There are some problems.

00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,184
It's really iffy.

00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,020
If I can't be all in,
I have to fold.

00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,256
So I'm sorry, I'm out.

00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,691
Aw.

00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,396
So, does any other board
have the hook

00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,098
where the handle goes
on it?

00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:49,301
Other boards do have hooks,
but they have recessing hooks,

00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,737
and part of the system
that makes this so great ‐‐

00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,639
When that hook recesses,
you have to push down

00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,975
to get it to pop back up,
which many people don't do.

00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,743
So, you know what I would've
loved to have seen?

00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,979
Yes?
'Cause that's a big,
important point of difference ‐‐

00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,547
probably the biggest
point of difference ‐‐

00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,816
I wouldn't have spent too
much time on the knee pads.

00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,518
I would have shown
the other product

00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,721
and pinched my fingers
in front of us and said...

00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,055
Right.
..."This is the problem."

00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,323
Yeah.
You said you have
four daughters.

00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,758
‐Yeah.
‐That was your biggest concern.

00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,227
Well, I don't want
to be negative.

00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,762
‐No.
‐Listen, you have to be willing

00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,764
to point out the difference
on why you're better.

00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,432
You're taking
your own sweat equity.

That's not about
being negative.

00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,435
Okay.

00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,403
It's not about
going negative.

00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,505
It's about being factual.

00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,207
You're asking us
to invest money in you.

00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,642
I have to feel comfortable.

00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:31,377
You shouldn't feel
bad about that.

As a lactation consultant,

reach their lactation goals,

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,420
and let's make Boobie
a household name.

00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,655
[ Laughter ]
I brought you some to taste.

00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,856
Great.

00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,558
What happens if men eat it?
[ Chuckles ]

00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,327
Well, if I could get
a man to lactate...

00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,662
If ‐‐
if you see a leak...

00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:07,633
I would ‐‐ I would already
be sitting in your chairs.

00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:08,967
Thank you, Daymond.

00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:09,868
O'Leary: Right here.
Thank you.

00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,136
‐Mr. Wonderful.
‐Thank you.

00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,371
Cuban: Thank you, Wendy.

00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:13,305
Blakely: So, these are three
different flavors?

00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,740
‐Three different flavors.
‐Okay.

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,542
Wendy, what's your
top‐selling flavor?

00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,043
Colson: Oatmeal chocolate chip.

00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,178
John: It's good, actually.

00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,379
‐Thank you!
‐It is good.

00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:22,047
Colson: There's a gluten‐free
peanut butter.

00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,082
Greiner: Ooh, I like
the peanut butter one.

00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,216
And there's
a blueberry coconut.

00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,017
The peanut butter
one's gluten‐free?

00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,185
Yes.
This is good.

00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,719
If I had knockers,
I'd eat this every day.

00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,488
How many other lactation
bars are there?

00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:32,591
There are no other lactation
bars in the commercial market.

00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,260
I wanted to give a more
convenient way

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,863
for the millennial mom
to take her herbs.

00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,398
A lot of people ‐‐
I have to ask a question ‐‐

00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:40,866
Do you have any proof
that they work,

00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:42,801
other than anecdotal
or personal ‐‐

00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,570
Anecdotal, for sure.

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,738
So, Wendy, is the story
for thousands of years,

00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:50,909
women have used these herbs
and spices to support lactation?

00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:51,977
Right.

00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:52,945
That's ‐‐
There's no medical test ‐‐

00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,313
They help other things,
right.

00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:56,081
‐Okay. Yeah.
‐But you don't have ‐‐

00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,985
To Mark's point, you haven't
done any clinical trials.

00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:03,388
Not clinical, but I,
before releasing the product,

00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,824
I did
my own independent study.

00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:09,461
So, I gave a group of moms
that I didn't know

00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,830
and just asked them
to eat one bar a day,

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,799
and then we studied
their milk supply

00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,736
and we saw in‐‐
increases from 1.5 to 4.6 a day.

00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:18,804
Ounces?

00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,739
Ounces, which is like
an extra feed.

00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:24,276
I've used this product
since 2011 with my patients.

00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:26,311
I'm a registered nurse,
and I'm also

00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,814
an internationally
board‐certified
lactation consultant.

00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,449
I'm an expert
in breast feeding.

00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,552
There's no higher credentials
for breast‐feeding education.

00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,387
I might be one of the only
people on the panel ‐‐

00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,689
I don't know ‐‐
that's breast fed, and ‐‐

00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,224
‐Mark breast fed.
‐Wait a second.

00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,792
I breast fed as well.

00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,328
It was a lot of years ago,
but I was involved.

00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,430
At Spanx, most of
my employees are women,

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,866
and we actually
have lactation rooms.

00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,768
Mm‐hmm.
And I think
this is interesting.

00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,136
Cuban:
So, anybody can make a claim,

00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,438
and anybody can mislead
a mother who needs the help ‐‐

00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,007
No.
No, no.
I'm not making a claim.

00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,208
That's what's ‐‐
But you are making claims

00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,544
because you have a bar
that you say

00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:02,748
is going to improve the ability
for a mom to lactate, right?

00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,483
But the expectation
of the mom

00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:06,518
is that she's gonna
get a result,

00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,321
yet you have no proof
that she's able to get a result

00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,789
other than your
personal experiences.

00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,157
‐This is not ‐‐
‐Well, look ‐‐

00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,193
Blakely: Okay, there's all these
energy bars on the market,

00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:18,163
and the herbs and the different
ingredients in the energy bars

00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,332
are what has been proven
to give energy.

00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:22,434
She has ‐‐
Are you serious?

00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,002
‐Yeah.
‐What do your customers say?

00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,170
Colson: All right, let me ‐‐
let me first ‐‐

00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,040
I‐I hear you all,
and I totally get it,

00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,608
and I want you to know that.

00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:32,778
You're probably not in business
to sell one bar to one person,

00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:33,946
'cause if it doesn't work,

00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:35,414
then you don't have
a business, right?

00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,883
And I think the bottom line
is the proof is in the pudding,

00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,952
and as you've been
out selling it

00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,420
have you been getting
reorders?

00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,522
Absolutely.
Can you give us
information about that,

00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:44,790
because, you know, I have
a 15‐month at home,

00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,892
and I know the ‐‐
the need for it.

00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,026
Right.

00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,361
So just tell us about
how many customers

00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,063
you had, reorders,
and things of that nature.

00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,064
Absolutely.

00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,565
Okay, so right now
on my website,

00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,668
I have a 52% repeat customer.

00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,971
Last month was 86%.

00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,439
Those are
impressive numbers.

00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,774
How many have you sold
since inception?

00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,309
My total sales...
So, what year did you start?

00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,846
...in ‐‐ in 2 years
are $778,000.

00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:08,847
‐Whoa!
‐Nice!

00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,115
That's fantastic.

00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,050
And I ‐‐
Well ‐‐ Well,
hold on there, cowboy!

00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,353
Well, wait a minute!
Yippie‐aye‐oh‐ki‐yay.

00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,221
Now you're speaking
their language, right?

00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,456
Right.
Okay.

00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,858
O'Leary: I believe in sales,
so let's just talk about

00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:23,128
how many women are lactating
at any one time in the market.

00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,496
How many in America?

00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,432
There's about
3.8 million births a year.

00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,868
81% initiate breast feeding,

00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,903
which means about
3 million moms.

00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:32,704
How do you get to them?

00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,072
I'm in 500 stores.

00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,307
What stores?

00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,109
Buy Buy Baby, Babies"R"Us,
I just got Walmart.

00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,977
How many stores
are they putting into?

00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,480
200, because it goes
in a specific section.

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,748
‐Yeah, yeah.
‐Got it, got it.

00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:43,815
‐And they're testing it.
‐So they're testing 200.

00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,050
So they started
a woman's section...

00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,052
‐Yeah.
‐...a one‐stop shop aisle

00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,520
for a woman
who just had a baby.

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,556
Have they told you their target
sell‐through to roll it out?

00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,760
No, they ‐‐ Um, I just know
I go on shelves in January.

00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,530
First of all, there's a huge
need for lactation expertise,

00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,399
so I'm not trying
to denigrate the need.

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,137
But that said, what concerns me
is you're making money,

00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,974
and if you really do get
confirmation through a study,

00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,977
you could be the one
that solves the problem.

00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,412
That should be
the first thing...

00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:16,515
Mm‐hmm.
...'cause then every doctor's
gonna recommend it.

00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,751
Every box can say
"Clinically proven

00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,521
to solve your problem
in these circumstances."

00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:23,455
Mm‐hmm.

00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,624
The fact that you don't,
to me,

00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:29,328
is just one more curse of
the supplement business, right,

00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,063
'cause everybody
makes lots of claims

00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,965
and people who are desperate
spend their money.

00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,134
I'm out.
Thank you.

00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,236
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,573
Because you don't have the
clinical testing at this time,

00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,676
I can't put my name
behind it,

00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,347
and for that reason,
I'm out.

00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:54,019
Wendy, I'm struggling
because I love the mission

00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,454
behind what you're doing.

00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:59,224
Where I'm getting caught up
is on the proven results.

00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:03,228
Like, that matters so deeply
to me for the consumer.

00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,930
The moms come back ‐‐
they buy.

00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,431
I know,
and I'm so proud of you,

00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,333
and I'm happy that
you have happy customers,

00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,635
but it's for
that reason that I ‐‐

00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,738
I need to be out.

00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:14,606
Thank you, Sara.

00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,641
You guys, I have something
called Club Boobie Bar.

00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:21,179
You sign up, and you get
five boxes, 30‐day supply, $79.

00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,683
I've had women on
Club Boobie Bar for over a year,

00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:28,019
so I know there's no,
like, clinical proof,

00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,421
but why would they buy...
‐Wendy, good news.

00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:30,655
...over and over ‐‐

00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,191
A third of my wine buyers
are in my wine club.

00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,960
They get a case
every 90 days.

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,063
I have a massive
fulfillment facility doing this.

00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,398
I love this business.
Mm‐hmm.

00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,299
Your proof is sales.

00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,034
In sales, I trust.

00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,438
I will give you
$150,000 for 20%.

00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,540
I think
a lot of work ahead ‐‐

00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,276
You have no idea
what Walmart's gonna be like.

00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,344
I do.

00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:53,779
That's an extraordinary
opportunity.

00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,380
Good on you
for getting it,

00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,449
but get ready
for some serious work,

00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:59,818
and serious
full‐time employees.

00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,153
And legal work, too.

00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:02,921
Thank you for your offer.

00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,491
Is there anyone else
that has anything?

00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,826
John: I think
you're the real deal.

00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,561
I don't necessarily agree
with my fellow Sharks,

00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,630
on if it could be
credible or not

00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,766
'cause I just really believe
that you either see

00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,568
it's working,
or you don't, right?

00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:17,769
Right.
And I ‐‐ And that's it.

00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,538
Uh, but I think
you're the star,

00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:22,441
and I think your information
has to get out there.

00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,777
I don't want you to be stuck
manufacturing and warehousing.

00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,947
My intent is to take you,
and we license this thing,

00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,552
and you are the face,
so $150,000 and 20%.

00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:36,688
Thank you so much
for your offer.

00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,858
Okay, Wendy, you have
two offers ‐‐

00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:42,106
Eugenia, I'm gonna
make you an offer.

00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,809
I like this,
and I like you.

00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:45,877
Oh, you're kidding.

00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:47,445
I'm not kidding.
Okay.

00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,281
I'm gonna match
Daymond's offer.

00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,685
I'm gonna give you
$60,000 for 35%.

00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:57,822
I have more than I can bring
to the table with my platform

00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,224
and all of the women
that I'm reaching out to,

00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,592
and I think that
most of the people

00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:04,963
that are gonna buy costumes
for their dogs are women.

00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,331
I think you're special.

00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:09,133
I can tell that you're gonna
make this work, so...

00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,101
Thank you so much.

00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,569
Yeah.
I really appreciate that.

00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,371
So, you have
two great Sharks,

00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:16,074
two great offers
on the table.

00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:19,377
Would you ever entertain
a deal together?

00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:22,280
Are you willing to give
away more equity?

00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,648
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,116
I'd be open to that.

00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,384
I'll be very honest.

00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:28,252
I ‐‐ I‐I have respect
for Sara.

00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,088
I don't know her history here.

00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:33,224
She probably can add
a massive amount of value,

00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,593
but I think I'm gonna
ride with this alone.

00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,862
I'm gonna stick
with my offer.

00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,564
Eugenia, you got
to make a decision.

00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:43,301
♪♪

00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:47,305
Daymond, I know that you
are an awesome person

00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:49,240
to work with in
the pet market...

00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,177
so I would love
to accept your offer.

00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,645
All right!

00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,080
‐Man, you made me beg for that.
‐Thanks for asking, Eugenia.

00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,382
I'd love to wear
the panda outfit.

00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:58,916
Thank you.
Not at all.

00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,651
Thank you so much.
‐So crazy.

00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,819
‐Congrats.
‐Congratulations!

00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:05,656
‐Congratulations.
‐Good job.

00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,725
Chen: It was more equity than
I initially planned on

00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,093
coming in with,

00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,795
but, you know, I know
what kind of value

00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,430
that Daymond
brings to the table.

00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,198
Um, it's incredible,
and I love that

00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,101
we're going to
support rescues, too.

00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,203
You know, I think I'm coming
down with something,

00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,606
'cause I just dreamt
that you gave $60,000

00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:23,608
for a rat‐dog outfit.
