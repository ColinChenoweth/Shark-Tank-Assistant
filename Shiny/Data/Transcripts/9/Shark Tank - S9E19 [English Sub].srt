00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,741
O'Leary:
And those attributes have merit,

00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,743
but they don't change
the distribution problem.

00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,712
The challenge is getting
this business

00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:22,314
to do $2 million or $3 million
or $4 million in sales.

00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,050
So, we've never been on cycle,
from a retail perspective.

00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,485
We're about to go
to three

00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,554
of the biggest
industry trade shows, so ‐‐

00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,889
I care about right now.

00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,758
I know what the risk is.
I know what the opportunity is.

00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,927
And we value what you would
bring to this business,

00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:38,397
so would you do
$200,000 for...

00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,933
...20%?

00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,968
No.
It's not interesting.

00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,538
You know, I'm very impressed

00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,506
that you got the Coast Guard
to endorse it.

00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,108
That, I've learned,
matters a lot.

00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:52,478
But you guys are so far
from distribution.

00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,014
You know, most people
that come in the Shark Tank

00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,382
don't get any offer at all.

00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,417
You have one,
and it's your last hope

00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,187
because I didn't hear anybody
else making you an offer.

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,927
Would you do
$200,000 for...

00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,330
...25%?

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,731
Not enough.

00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,338
Mr. Wonderful, we're gonna have
to decline that 50/50 offer.

00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,406
‐Good for you guys.
‐Good for you.

00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,707
‐Yeah.
‐Well, good luck.

00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,976
‐Thank you very much.
‐Congrats on the business, guys.

00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:27,246
‐Good luck at the trade show.
‐Congratulations on everything.

00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:28,914
Even though we didn't get
a deal today,

00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,649
we're gonna keep going
with our product.

This is all about

and we know that if we get
the product out there,

00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:35,487
we can help to make
a difference.

Hi, Sharks.
My name is Kelechi Anyadiegwa.

00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,447
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia,

00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,682
and I'm the founder and C. E. O.
of Zuvaa.

00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,652
Today, I'm looking for $460,000

00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:09,154
in exchange for 10%
of my company.

00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,791
Growing up Nigerian,
I was always enamored

00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,360
by unique prints and textiles.

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,296
The colors, the vibrancy ‐‐
it always amazed me.

00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:18,998
And I knew there were
talented designers

00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,366
on the African continent

00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,868
who had a gift for creating
beautiful pieces.

00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:26,272
But the problem is, these
designers did not have the tools

00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:29,041
nor the resources
to tap a global market.

00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,110
This is why I created Zuvaa.

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,246
We are the fastest‐growing
online marketplace

00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,581
for global design.

00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,150
We connect these incredibly
talented designers

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,920
with consumers globally who are
looking for unique finds.

00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,755
Let me tell you how it works.

00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,457
Consumers simply browse
our online marketplace

00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:50,029
currently consisting over 85
handpicked, curated designers.

00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,497
Once they've placed
their orders,

00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,799
their items are shipped to them
directly from the designer

00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,468
or from our fulfillment center
in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:23:56,468 --> 00:24:00,272
Madison is wearing Titi's
Closet, and she is from Nigeria,

00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,941
so it's a beautiful jumpsuit

00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,443
with peplum on the sides
and on the top.

00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,346
And then Michelle is wearing
a designer from Zambia.

00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,481
And so she likes to mix
her prints

00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,284
using wax prints and chiffons
in her materials.

00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,687
And then, this designer's
also from Nigeria,

00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,789
and this is
an all‐chiffon material,

00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,490
and so it's really beachy.

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,192
Now join me as we show the world

00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,294
the beauty of Africa
through design.

00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,096
I'd love to show you guys
some samples.

00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,898
‐Sure.
‐Just to give you an idea of ‐‐

00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,333
‐Please do!
‐Oh, that's nice.

00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,234
So, yeah, you can just kind of
pass them down.

00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,603
I wanted you guys to see more
of the quality of the pieces.

00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,206
Daymond, what you're holding
actually comes from Nigeria,

00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,709
and it's made out of ashoké,
which is woven textile,

00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,944
and that one comes from Benin,

00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,348
and it's made with Ankara print,
wax print, and suede.

00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,749
Could I wear this
at the pool?

00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,651
That looks fabulous on you,
Mr. Wonderful.

00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,252
I do wear wraps, you know.

00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,554
I love that.

00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:51,156
So, Kele, how do you
find these women?

00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,258
So, we actually find it
by word of mouth.

00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,095
And we also have a very strict
vetting policy,

00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,930
so all designers
who are interested

00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,499
in selling through Zuvaa,
they send us their samples.

00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,735
And we're able to really check
quality control

00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:05,437
as well as understanding
what their process is

00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,706
for fulfillment
and customer service.

00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,708
How did you come up
with his idea?

00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,311
I'm a first‐generation Nigerian.
This is my culture, right?

00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,712
I grew up wearing these pieces.

00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,315
I actually started Zuvaa
while I was in grad school.

00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:19,451
I was at Carnegie‐Mellon,
and during that time,

00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,854
I start to freelance
in social‐media marketing,

00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,188
and people would ask me
all the time,

00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,757
"Kelechi, where'd you get that?"

00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:27,493
I realized how inaccessible
African prints and textiles

00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,294
were to people
in Western markets.

00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,996
‐Right.
‐So I started with

00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,865
about a $500 investment,

00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,768
and I was able to turn that
into over $2 million...

00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:36,935
Whoa!

00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,537
...in sales
in under 2 1/2 years.

00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,339
[ Applause ]
Thank you.

00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,975
‐Wow!
‐That's amazing.

00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,309
‐Thank you.
‐Okay.

00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:48,714
So, explain, if I'm a designer
and I want to be on your site,

00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,549
what is the financial
relationship?

00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,152
So, we charge
a 17% flat commission

00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,453
to be on the marketplace,

00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,755
and then we also charge
a monthly fee of $50.

00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,690
And how many visitors
do you have to the site?

00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,260
Monthly, we have
about 120,000 visitors.

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,761
‐Good for you.
‐So, now the question.

00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:03,762
That's fabulous.

00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,999
Last month, what
did you do in revenue?

00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:10,903
Monthly, we're doing about
$220,000 in sales,

00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,038
so about $50,000 in revenue.

00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,840
So you make $50K a month.

00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,974
Mm‐hmm.

00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,743
That's basically
off of your commission.

00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,744
‐Yes.
‐Right.

00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,179
So, basically,
you have no risk.

00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,413
‐Yeah.
‐Which is brilliant.

00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,748
‐Yeah.
‐But let me ask something.

00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,250
There is a risk. You know,
when women order online,

00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,952
it's a higher return rate often

00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,754
because they order
two sizes, right?

00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,722
"I don't know if I'm a 7
or an 8 today," right?

00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:31,790
Yeah, that's happened.

00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,059
What happens in the event
of a return?

00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,662
Because you either have to put
that back in inventory

00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,330
or send it back to Africa.
What happens in that?

00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,266
Yeah. So, Zuvaa handles all
the returns for the customers.

00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,603
So they get a return slip, and,
you know, they send the items

00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,239
back to us in Atlanta,
and then we send those items

00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,142
back to the designers
usually every quarter or so

00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,744
to cut down on costs.
‐You're getting $50K a month.

00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,247
What does it cost you to run it?
You got some staff?

00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,950
Yes. I mean, our burn,
monthly, is about $50K,

00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,651
so we break even monthly.

00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:03,755
Okay. So what's the vision for
why it's worth $4.6 million?

00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,757
So, our valuation is really
just based

00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,093
off of 2X multiple
of our GMV from last year.

00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,195
Has anybody paid that value?
Is anybody invested in it?

00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,597
No, we haven't had
any investment.

00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,398
We've been bootstrapped
the whole three years.

00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,833
‐So you own 100% of it?
‐I own 92%.

00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,168
And who owns the other 8%?

00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,469
My other advisers.

00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,737
So I'm gonna guess right now

00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,372
you're very flexible
on valuation.

00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,574
Well, she's saying
that she's worth $4.6 million

00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:23,876
right now, correct?
‐Yes.

00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,644
Greiner:
You're doing fantastic.

00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,745
Mm‐hmm.

00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,947
So why do you need a Shark?

00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,817
There's so much more that I want
to do with this company, right?

00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:35,587
I want for us to be able
to really create global impact

00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,755
and for people around the world

00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,423
to see the beauty
of African fashion design

00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,125
beyond just fashion, right?

00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,628
I mean, there's home apparel,
there's art.

00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:45,063
There's so much beauty
that's coming out of Africa,

00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,865
so for us to really scale up,

00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,433
we're going to need investment

00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,636
to build out
a scalable online platform.

00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,137
Right now, our online platform

00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,907
does not meet the needs
of our vendors or our consumers.

00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:57,342
What is the price‐point range
for your outfits?

00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,012
So, we range from $50 to $250.

00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,046
That's not bad.

00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,814
That's reasonably priced
for what this is.

00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,016
‐Yeah.
‐It looks good.

00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,751
You know, I think the mistake
in your deal,

00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,152
just right out of the gate here,

00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,788
$460,000 is a lot of money.

00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,823
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐But she's got to scale.

00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,326
Yeah, but I'm having a hard time
at $4.6 million.

00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,895
How many designers
do you want to grow to?

00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,464
On the continent right now,
there are hundreds,

00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:20,999
if not thousands of designers

00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,202
who could do a variety of
pieces, right?

00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,504
And that's what I'm really
looking to scale up to.

So, the 25,000 units you sold,
were they part of a Kickstarter,

00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,893
or was that real sales
to retail?

00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,429
So, in 2015, we were fully
funded on Kickstarter.

00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:08,366
In 2016, we prototyped it,
countless iterations.

00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,536
And then, four months ago,
we fulfilled 25,000 units.

00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,338
Any of the baby retailers
pick it up yet?

How much do each one of these
units cost to make?

00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,583

We had yet to pass safety.

to de‐risk it, right?

We had to go into production,
we had to get distribution

00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,328
