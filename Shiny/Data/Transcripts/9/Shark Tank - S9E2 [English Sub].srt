I mean, to this day,

00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:26,414
it is crystal clear
in my mind and my eyes.

00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:28,649
Like, I ‐‐ I see it
right here.

00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,486

that level of pain,

I mean, power to you.

00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,728
Thank you.
Thank ‐‐ thank you.

00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:42,396
You have more courage
than I did...

00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:44,565
Thank you.
...and that's very admirable.

00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:48,736
Um...great packaging,
great branding.

00:13:48,736 --> 00:13:50,471

to make women cry.

Well...

it's...it's turning
something ‐‐

00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:02,583
like lemons into lemonade

00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,353
and turning
this very difficult experience

00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:07,522
into something
really positive.

00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:10,625
Let me start by commending you
on a product

00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:14,428
that is absolutely disrupting
the food and beverage base.

00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:15,563
Thank you.
Thank you so much
for saying that.

00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,199
I always look for stuff
that is breaking the mold

00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:18,833
of what's out there today.

00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,503
Everything out there
is high sugar, high fat ‐‐

00:14:22,503 --> 00:14:25,273
not the good stuff
that you need.

00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:27,508
You're bringing
the good fats in.

00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:29,610

a little bit now

Sure.

...and my rudimentary
mathematics ‐‐

00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:37,451
I'm Indian, so it's actually
a little more than rudimentary.

00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:38,653
We have to be good
at math.
Oh.

00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:39,654
[ Laughs ]
Culturally, we have
to be good at math.

00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:42,490
Wow.
So, this is
worth $25 million

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,791
is what you are valuing
the company at.

00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,427
That's correct.
So that's a hefty valuation.

00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,562
It is.
Walk me through that,

00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:49,197
and how did you get there?

00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:50,298
Tell us about the sales.

00:14:50,298 --> 00:14:52,266
Last year,
it was $10.1 million.

00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,467
‐There you go.
‐Wow.

00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:54,669
What'd you do
the year before?

00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:56,671
Year before
was $5.4 million.

00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:58,539
And the year before?
And before that,
$1.4 million.

00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:00,107
Are you profitable?

00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,243
Not yet.

00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:03,311
Okay,
how much are you losing?

00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:07,148
We lost, last year,
about $1.7 million.

00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:08,382
‐Why is that?
‐Whew.

00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:10,318
Producing these chips ‐‐
It's an expensive game.

00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:12,420
Yeah. Food,
as a general rule of thumb,

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,555
is a difficult business
from a margin standpoint.

00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:16,424
It takes a lot of money
to produce products.

00:15:16,424 --> 00:15:17,558
What's your margin
on these?

00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:20,595
But why were you losing
that much money last year?

00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:22,396
Because we grew
so fast.
Yes.

00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:23,497
So getting shelf space

00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:24,832
is actually
quite an expensive endeavor.

00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:26,434
‐You paid slotting fees ‐‐
‐Uh, but that's okay.

00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:27,401
‐So...
‐Well, hang on.

00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:28,502
You got to explain that
to us.

00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:29,503
But ‐‐ but did you have
to pay slotting fees?

00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:30,605
Scott: Sure.
But, in a natural channel,

00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:31,973
it's not slotting fees,
it's free fill.

00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,742
So we give away, literally,
cases of our product...
Greiner: Right.

00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:36,344
...in order to gain
that shelf space.

00:15:36,344 --> 00:15:37,578
What does that add
to your costs?

00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:39,580
Last year,
it was about 18%...
Corcoran: That's huge.

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,482
...18.4% ‐‐ very large.

00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,617
That's huge.

00:15:42,617 --> 00:15:45,419
So it's like giving
one out of five bags free

00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:46,721
to stay in the door.

00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:50,258
So, at what point,
do you become profitable?

00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:51,525
Next year, actually.
Pretty soon, actually.

Really, we're really close.
Yes, we've got it
modeled out.

of the costs?

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,381
Two‐thirds.

00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:14,382
Two‐thirds, okay.

and $14 million run rate
right now for this year.

00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:21,956
So, run rate means you're doing
about $1 million a month?

$1 million ‐‐
We just had our largest,
uh, month ever in May ‐‐

had growth rates from ‐‐

so similar to you...
Yes.

...then we were at a 17...
Yes.

...and then we're at a 45.

00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:42,343
Yeah.
So...

00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:43,477
But how much did you spend
on marketing?

00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:44,612
We spent a fair bit
on marketing,

00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:47,348
but ‐‐ but here I saw ‐‐
I like the 1.45.

00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:49,383
I like that to the 10.

Why am I not going
10 to 20 here?

00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,687
Where's ‐‐
why am I going 10 to 12, 13?

00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:54,722
Frankly, we had to pump
the brakes a little bit.

00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,524
Yes.
You know, there ‐‐
you know,

00:16:56,524 --> 00:16:59,393

00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:01,429
That's correct.
Correct.

00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:02,730
So, of the $12 million,

$13 million expected to do
this year,

00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:05,599
how big do you think
Whole Foods would be?

00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,135
Whole Foods would be
approximately 13% of that.

‐13%?

00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,604

Doing only, um, $1.5 million
at Whole Foods three years in,

00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:17,278
that number doesn't strike me
as exciting.

Rohan Oza is interested
in Jackson's Honest,

00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:13,427
a coconut oil‐based
chip company,

00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:16,564
but he's concerned
about the high valuation.

00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:21,936
Megan and Scott, $1.25 million
is a lot of money,

00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:26,273
and I feel that the amount of
equity that I'm getting for that

00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:27,675
needs to be a lot higher.

00:19:27,675 --> 00:19:30,511
But I also feel the value
I bring

00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:33,514
will justify
what I'm asking for.

00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:35,216
The 5% is way too low.

00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,218
It needs to be more like 20%.

00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,352
20%?
20%.

00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:40,488
20%.

00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:43,257
So he wants to take the
valuation from $25 million...

00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:44,825
Sure. Exactly.
...to $6.25 million.

00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,560
So let me explain a little bit
if you understand why...

00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,396
Yeah.
...because every company
I've been involved in,

00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,564
I was never the founder.

00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,732

Oh, there you go!
There you go.

Yes ‐‐ well, I actually
just recently just graduated.

00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,240
Do you have a job?
Congratulations.

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,375
Uh, actually I turned ‐‐

00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:57,377

a couple jobs, opportunities.

00:33:57,377 --> 00:33:59,379
I turned down interviews
from Facebook and Google.

00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:01,214
I was my school's
Google Student Ambassador.

00:34:01,214 --> 00:34:02,315
How do you make money
today?

00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:03,383
What do you do
for a living?

00:34:03,383 --> 00:34:04,684
So, right now,
this is all that I do.

00:34:04,684 --> 00:34:06,686
I'm ‐‐ I literally, like ‐‐

00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:13,560

Wait, wait, so...

00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,662

iOS developer for this app.

00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:17,197

Good for you.

00:34:17,197 --> 00:34:17,697
Oh, good for you, yeah.

00:34:17,697 --> 00:34:19,466

00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:20,667
So, I uploaded it to the ‐‐

00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:23,403
to the App Store ‐‐
App Store in October.

00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:24,537
Do you have
any customers?

00:34:24,537 --> 00:34:26,473
Yes.
Right now we have only ‐‐

00:34:26,473 --> 00:34:28,608
we ‐‐ we have
about 850 downloads

00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,744
with 160 monthly
active users.

00:34:30,744 --> 00:34:33,513
Okay, so, there are other apps
that do this?

00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:34,547
Yes.
Right?

00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:36,416
So, tell ‐‐
Well, so ‐‐ similar.

00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,450
Who cares
about the competitors?

00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,451
Why are you better?

00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,552
So, basically,
why we're better

00:34:39,552 --> 00:34:40,787
is the fact
that our main goal

00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,757
is not right now trying
to be an airport directory.

00:34:43,757 --> 00:34:45,759
Our main goal is to actually
connect air travelers

00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:48,595
within the airport, kind of like
a Waze of the indoor space.

00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:50,463
So being able
to connect travelers

00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,298
who are being able to, like ‐‐
TSA wait times.

00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,366
That's completely different.

00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:54,434
‐Yeah, that's ‐‐
‐I mean, that's ‐‐

00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:55,769
But isn't Google Maps
doing a lot of that?

00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:58,438
Well, the thing is ‐‐
Google Maps
has your destination stuff...

00:34:58,438 --> 00:34:59,506
Yes.
...where it will
literally track

00:34:59,506 --> 00:35:01,174
where you walk
in the airport.

00:35:01,174 --> 00:35:02,475
Yes. W‐We actually use ‐‐

00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,344
we're actually using
the Google Maps API.

00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:06,179
The thing that, like,
differentiates us

00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:06,880
between us and Google Maps

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,517
is the fact that we're trying
to make a‐a community

00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:13,286
of travelers that basically
are able

00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:14,354
to communicate
with one another.

00:35:14,354 --> 00:35:15,488
Corcoran: Ryan,
let me ask you something ‐‐

00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,425
if, for example,
you were able to get $100,000...

00:35:18,425 --> 00:35:19,659
Yes.
...here in the Tank,

00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,361
what would you do
with that money?

00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:22,595
My "A" priority is
to get a developer

00:35:22,595 --> 00:35:23,663
that's better than me,

00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,466
to be able
to parse flight itineraries,

00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:28,301
to be able to load them
into our application.

00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:30,370
Wow.
And since I graduated,

00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,405
our monthly active users
have jumped by 40%.

00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:33,473
To what? How many?

00:35:33,473 --> 00:35:35,508
169 monthly actives.
Th‐That's ‐‐

00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,609
That's a throwaway number,
Ryan.

I understand ‐‐
I understand that it's a ‐‐

00:35:38,211 --> 00:35:38,812
it's very low.

00:35:38,812 --> 00:35:41,548
Are you plugged in some
kind of a back end system ‐‐

00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:42,816
a directory
within the airports?

00:35:42,816 --> 00:35:45,318
No, we do not.
Oza: And are you adding
manually,

00:35:45,318 --> 00:35:46,553
like someone goes there
and gets this data?

00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:47,654
How are you getting
the information?

00:35:47,654 --> 00:35:50,457
So, basically,
I‐I work with my ‐‐ my brother

00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:52,792

data aggregation from hours ‐‐

00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,427
From public websites

Online.

00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:56,563
Exactly, from hours, reviews,
all these things,

00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:58,231
and aggregating that
into our back end ‐‐

00:35:58,231 --> 00:35:59,499
‐That's tough.
‐And...

00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:02,168
Trying to aggregate that data
essentially manually...

00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:02,635
Mm‐hmm.
It's manually.

00:36:02,635 --> 00:36:04,370
That's hard.
It is.

00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,805
Why not tie into
the back end airport systems?

00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:07,674
Well, because we don't have
connections in the ‐‐

Greiner: You know,
you said something

00:36:12,245 --> 00:36:14,848
that I thought
was quite brilliant.

00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:18,651
You said you want
to become the Waze for airports.

00:36:18,651 --> 00:36:20,587
I personally think,
if you could,

00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:23,690
the biggest problem
ever in airports

00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,559
is not knowing what
that line's gonna be like...

00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,727
Security.
...when you get there.

00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,896
Mm‐hmm.
That would be
an amazing home run.

00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,398
The reason why I didn't come
in here pitching that,

00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,234
because we don't have
that functionality

00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,468
