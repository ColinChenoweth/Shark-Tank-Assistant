Growing up

00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,765
it's impossible to ignore the

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,536
is the lifeblood
of these trees.

Their roots pull nutrient‐rich
groundwater from the soil,

00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,208
which combines with
the sugar stored in the trees

00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,444
to form this complex
substance, known as sap,

ingredient ‐‐ maple sap ‐‐

more water from the sap

of a soda‐like experience.

00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,045
in a nutrition sense.
Give it to us in one line.

00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,413
‐Yeah.
‐One line.

00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,816
Basically, I would say this ‐‐
It protects your body.

00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,918
How does it help
with inflammation?

00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,953
Because that's the big
buzzword now, right?
Yep.

00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,989
Everybody's saying
inflammation causes cancer.

00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:32,759
So, how does this stop
inflammation in the body?

00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,127
Or help lessen it?

00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,962
It's this complex substance
that has,

00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,764
you know,
not just 46 nutrients,

00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,566
but also a lot of kind
of bioactive properties.

00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,134
And so, you know,
we've actually been working

00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,535
with University of Vermont,

00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,870
University of Cornell
a little bit

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,839
to study these properties
a little bit more.

00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,307
We're helping to try
to bring new research

00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,341
out there right now.

have that yet?

Yeah, there's some research
out there, absolutely.

00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,751
I think our top customer

00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,886
is probably a mom
buying for her family

00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,988
who has a slightly
higher willingness to pay.

00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,556
She's wanting to buy it
for her kids

00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:07,227
because it's a much better
option than a traditional soda.

00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,962
Her husband's
probably not gonna use it.

trying to accomplish,

So I want to give you
some credit on that.

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:47,527
My struggle is, you can't
get me a why quickly enough

00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,497
so that when I have
the 5 seconds on the shelf,

00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,898
I'm gonna reach in
and grab it.

00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,567

that the functional benefit

to me doesn't exist.

okay?

If you want to have a campfire
in your backyard,

00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,579
you take this out,
and you throw it up.

Why couldn't I just take a tin
and put a couple InstaFires in

00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,250

It's convenient.

Okay, how much?
What was your goal?

00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,569

No, no.

the concept proved

were interested in it,

traditional wholesale retail.

What kind of retail?

00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,053
Surf shops, camp stores...

My wife and I
were on vacation.

Even before we were shipping,
I had samples of it,

00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,960
We went to Kauai,
and we were using it,

00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,696
taking pictures of it,
and people were coming up

00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,130
and saying, "Oh, my God,

Guys. Hey, guys.

Can you put a lid on it?

00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,439
Yeah. Pardon?

00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,474
In areas

Sure.

Yeah,

is a contained fire, okay?

00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,583
This is a contained fire,

00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,051
and so, yeah,
you're allowed to do it.

00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,388
You can shut it on and off, just
like I‐I‐I demonstrated here.

00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,590
So you can have a campfire
and literally get up and leave,

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,725
and no one knows
you were there.

00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,093
What are the other scents?

00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,395
Is that
a mosquito‐repelling one?
That's correct.

00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,664
It has eucalyptus
and lemon oil in it

00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,332
to repel mosquitoes.

00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,400

As soon as you open up
the tin,

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,075
there's a warning label
and instruction manual inside.

What's a little bit?

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,978
How many years ago
did you start?
Sure.

00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,114
So, I honestly started
this journey, if you will,

00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:16,281
about 10 years ago.

00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,282
10?

00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,385
2010, we went
to the largest trade show,

00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:21,487
and we were overwhelmed
with the response that we got.

00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,756
Did you ‐‐ Did you have sales
during that time?

00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:27,359
We had o‐over a dozen companies
asking us to export the product.

00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,294
We had no idea
how to do that.

00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:32,297
We had no idea what
a container of product would be.

00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,134
And so, we went to go to get
a small‐business loan.

00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,736
Everybody knows
what was going on in 2010.

00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,505
There were
no small‐business loans,

00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:42,141
certainly not for a female
business owner at that time.

00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,475
And so, we had to shelve it.

00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,411
And you've decided
to bring this back to life.

00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,545

in exchange for 5%
of our company.

00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,030
Whoo!
[ Chuckles ]

00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,868
Everytable is a healthy,
grab‐and‐go concept

00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,470
that's revolutionizing
the restaurant industry

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,774
and making healthy food
affordable for everyone.

00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:51,643
Demand for healthy food
is exploding,

00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:55,414
but the truth is,
when salads cost $15

00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,749
and green juices cost $9,

00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,586
healthy food has become
a luxury that few can afford.

00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,955
Even worse,
there are some neighborhoods

00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,057
called food deserts

00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,861
that have absolutely no access
to healthy food at all.

00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:12,197
At Everytable, we believe

00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,766
that healthy food
is a human right.

00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,569
And here is how we are
making that a reality.

00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:20,138
Every morning
at our central kitchen,

00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,575
our world‐class chefs
prepare incredibly fresh,

00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:26,611
healthy, and, importantly,
delicious meals.

00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,281
Things like
a kale chicken Caesar salad,

00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,916
vegan miso grain bowls,

00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,685
and an out‐of‐this‐world
Jamaican jerk chicken

00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,388
with coconut, beans and rice,
and plantains,

00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,591
which are then packaged
and sent to our restaurants.

00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,259
Centralized production
results

00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,728
in incredible efficiencies
in the kitchen

00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,197
and makes our locations

00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:48,166
significantly cheaper
to build and operate.

00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,302
We opened stores
in affluent communities

00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,237
and food‐desert
communities.

00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,973
And to make sure that our food
is affordable for everyone,

00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,743
we vary the prices based on what
that neighborhood can afford.

00:32:58,743 --> 00:32:59,911
We're on a mission

00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,414
to make good food
available for everyone.

00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,416
So, help us put
an Everytable

00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:07,319
in every community
all across America.

00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,021
You want to try some food?
Greiner: Yes.

00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,022
‐Sure.
‐Why not?

00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,090
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah, let's do it.

00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,091
May I try
that jerk chicken, please?

00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,493
‐That's yours, actually.
‐Yes.

00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,861
Is it jerk chicken and miso?
Foster: Barbara, you've got

00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,662
the Jamaican jerk chicken
for you.
Ladies first.

00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,698
This is for you,
a kale chicken Caesar salad.

00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:22,033
For you,
Puebla chicken tinga.

00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,134
And, Robert...
Thank you.

00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,636
...ensalada fresca
with chicken for you.

00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,371
Thank you.
So, you've got
the dressing in there,

00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,973
cheese if you'd like it.

00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,174
‐Great.
‐Food tastes fantastic.

00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,242
Greiner: Yeah.

00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:31,643
Oza: By the way, I'm very much

00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,645
bought in to your guys'
philosophy.

00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,013
If you are lower income,

00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,415
your access to better foods
gets reduced,

00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,084
and you're stuck
with the bad products

00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:40,352
because they're cheap.

00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,487
So, I love the way
you're varying the pricing on,

00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,389
you know,
if you can afford more,

00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,458
you pay more, and if you can't,
you pay less.

00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,393
Wait, explain that again,
'cause I missed that part.

00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,829
Yeah, so we have locations
in affluent areas,

00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:53,899
like Century City, Santa Monica,
and downtown,

00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,635
and in those locations,
the stores sell these meals

00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:57,969
for $7 or $8.

00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,671
But we also opened stores

00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:02,541
in places like South L. A.,
Baldwin Hills,

00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,776
and coming soon,
Watts and Compton.
Mmm.

00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,245
And in those communities,
we sell the same meals,

00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:11,149
from the same stores, for exac‐‐
for basically $4 to $5.

00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,919
And each location is meant
to be profitable,

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,687
but just differently
profitable.

00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,590
So you mentioned food deserts.
What exactly is that?

00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,759
So, we ‐‐
let me show you up here.

00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,994
So this is a map
of Los Angeles.

00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,297
These are all the sort of
affluent communities.

00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:29,200
So you have Santa Monica
and Beverly Hills and Pasadena,

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,103
and in those locations,
per capita income

00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:35,740
can be sometimes
$100,000, $150,000.

00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,475
In this location,

00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,445
this is neighborhoods like
South Los Angeles,

00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,147
Watts, Compton.

00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:45,350
You can have per capita income
as low as $13,000 a year.

00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,418
Wow.

00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,719
Now, these communities,

00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,121
they're left out
of a functioning,
healthy food system.

00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:54,059
So, for example, folks born
in this zip code right here

00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,761
will live on average
12 years less

00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,229
than folks born in this,

00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,565
even though
they're 5 miles apart.

00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:04,135
Why is there no healthy food
being pumped into those deserts?

00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,271
If you think
about a fast‐food chain,

00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,707
they have potatoes,
which last forever,

00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:09,975
they have frozen beef,

00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,943
they have buns
that never go bad,

00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,411
and they're all
very cheap.
Hmm.

00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,481
So, you can run a business
that sells those foods at $5.

00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,216
Makes sense.
If you're running
a healthy‐food business,

00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,452
you have fresh food,

00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,420
there's more spoilage,
issues like that,

00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,189
so it's hard to get
to a price point

00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,590
that is comparable
to fast food...

00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,094
I see.
...unless you structure it
from the beginning,

00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:31,096
like we have,
to hit that price point.

00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:33,898
Oza:
You're coming for $1 million,
which is a big amount.

00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,668
You're then asking ‐‐
You're only giving up 5%,

00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:38,303
which, if my math is correct,
has put you

00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,605
at a $20 million valuation.
Is that correct?

00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:41,606
That's correct.
That's correct.

00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:42,807
It's a healthy valuation.

00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,442
Help me understand
why you think

00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,578
your company's already worth
$20 million.

00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,880
Let me just tell you
a little bit about our
fundraising history.

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,348
‐Sure.
‐So, we raised a seed round

00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,917
of $2.9 million
on a convertible note.

00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,086
‐Of what valuation?
‐A valuation cap at $7 million.

00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,522
Subsequent to that,
raised $2 million

00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,058
at a $23.5 million
valuation cap.

00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:02,494
In terms of revenue, last year
we opened our first location,

00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,329
so that's in South L. A.

00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,132
That one did
about $650,000.

00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,400
Oh, that's great.

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,101
And the way ‐‐ We had
one location last summer.

00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,302
We now have five.

00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,972
So all rolled up,
the five locations,

00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,341
the current run rate
is about $2.6 million.

00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,277
So, are you burning money
right now?

00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,578
Yeah, we are.

00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,914
Our burn rate right now
is about $125,000 a month.

00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,183
And that's basically
because

00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,485
we've invested heavily
for growth.

00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,354
So, what's your typical cost,

00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,857
um, for a bowl, all in,
overhead?

00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,093
$2.50 to 3 bucks, all in.

00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:38,630
So, even when you're selling
for $5 in the food desert,

00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,932
you're at a 40% to 50%
gross margin,

00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,467
60% to 70% when
you're selling

00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,135
for 8 bucks
in the affluent markets.

00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,271
Can you share with me
your backgrounds?

00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,139
I grew up in Los Angeles

00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,841
and was always
super ambitious.

00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,943
Went to Columbia and then
went to Wall Street.

00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,179
And by the time I was 30,
I was a senior trader

00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:56,147
at one of the largest
hedge funds in the world.

00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,949
During the crash
of '08 and '09,

00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:02,454
I started to shift
my vision of success.

00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,089
And so, I left that world

00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:07,225
and started a non‐profit
called Groceryships

00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,028
that helps parents
that are living in food deserts

00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,830
get themselves
and their families healthy.

00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,898
And that's ‐‐ David and I met
through the non‐profit.

00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,334
I love what you did here today.

00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,504
It's rare that we see someone
present so cleanly,

00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,705
have all the answers,

00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,640
keep their cool,
answer every question.

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,543
But the whole time,
I'm trying so hard to like it,

00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,812
and I'm thinking, "What the hell
is bugging me here?"

00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,782
Somehow, I don't think
you're entrepreneurs.

00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,584
I don't feel
a fire in your belly.

00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,053
You can call my wife
and ask her.
No, no, no.
Here's what I want to say.

00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,988
You're not bringing it
on the table here today.

00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,823
I'm just gonna trust
my instinct on this.

00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,492
I wish you luck,
and I admire your mission,

00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,461
but I'm out.

00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,030
What you've achieved in one
year, I think it's fantastic.

00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,267
But, here‐‐ here's
my only challenge.

00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,303
You know, in business, I like
to follow the poo‐poo principle,

00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,839
which is poo poo happens,

00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:59,210
and the amount of money
that you've raised

00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,880
and the valuation you have
of $20 million,

00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,216
there is no room for poo poo.

00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,051
You basically have built in

00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:11,422
flawless execution
from now into the future.

00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,259
I just know from reality,
poo poo happens.

00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:15,894
I'm out.

00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,230
I love the mission.

00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,432
It's in sync with everything
that I'm about.

00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:24,569
Here's my problem.

00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,504
It's easy to raise money,

00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,006
especially from where
you come from.

00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:32,610
But what I wanted
to hear today was...

00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,948
creativity, drive,
fire, and marketing.

00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:41,619
But you were missing
that really important component.

00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,489
So, unfortunately, I'm out.

00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,592
On one hand,
I was really excited,

00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,327
because the mission's awesome.

00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,597
But the crusade part
scares the hell out of me.

00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,699
$20 million valuation

00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,435
means you need to generate
$20 million in profits

00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,337
before I get my money back.

00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,839
Right?

00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:01,973
You're going
to have to go through a lot

00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,776
of painful lessons first, right?

00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,312
And I think the valuation,
to Robert's point,

00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:10,348
isn't there to go through
the difficult times.

I'm out.

Oza:
I do like your idea.

00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:18,289
My issue is your valuation
should be more in line

00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:21,693
with what the market is.

00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,094
I'll give you the upper end,

00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,197
which is three times
your run rate, as you call it.

00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,800
That would put you
at $7.5 million valuation.

We appreciate the offer.

The forecast for next year is ‐‐
is $6 million
