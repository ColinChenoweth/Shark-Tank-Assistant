so I was involved
in vitamin water,

00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,935
so, SmartWater, Bai ‐‐
All very early‐stage companies

00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,438
went on to become
billion‐dollar exits,

00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,473
so I'm looking
on "Shark Tank"

00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,742
for the next
billion‐dollar exit.

00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:12,377
That starts
with a few things.

00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,446
Give me your margins.
How much are you making it for?

00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,780
What are you
selling it for?

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,049
And where are you making this
at the moment?

00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,151
Absolutely.
So, we have a 43% gross margin,

00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,454
which is pretty good for ‐‐
for the beverage category.

00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,390
So your cost,
your total cost to goods is...?

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,626
A dollar and 5 cents
a bottle. That's
ingredients, that's label,

00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,929
that's blending, that's boxing,
pallets, all that stuff.

00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,330
And then the cost?

00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,299
We sell it to distributors
for $1.85.

00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,867
Our price on the shelf
is $3.29.

00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,803
So, $3.29 compared to
your competitor ‐‐

00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,071
how much are they?

00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:43,308
So, a Starbucks product
is gonna be right around $2.99.

00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,476
Right.
And then
where we talk about

00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,710
this new,
enhanced category.

00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,278
This is really
what makes us different.

00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,014
If you see products
that are using the protein

00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,248
and the coconut oil
and butter,

00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,384

on the shelf at Whole Foods

00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:55,387

we're gonna be healthier,

we're gonna be sweet but
relatively low‐calorie, right?

00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:04,496

Yep.

the cash required.

How much
have you guys raised?

00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,203
We've raised
$1.3 million,

Because I see some of
these things out there already.

Exactly, Rohan. So, so,
Bulletproof is a ‐‐ a
little bit different target,

I would say,
a little bit older audience.

00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,659
For us, if ‐‐
if you're looking at

00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,162
the R. T. D. coffee space
right now,

00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:38,430
95% of it is Starbucks.

00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,631
That's it.

00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,166
There's not
a lot of competition out there,

00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,034
but it is
the fastest‐growing category

00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,502
in beverage space
right now.

00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,171
If you ask
a lot of our consumers,

00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,006
they're seeing something
that's affordable,

00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,741
that they like,
that they like the taste,

00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:52,277
only 7 grams of sugar
from organic maple syrup.

00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,447
$400,000 year to date.

have taught me over time,

00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,020
that's yet to come.

00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,621
We'd like to know
what's in the bank today.

00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:04,923
So,
$400,000 so far.

00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:07,425
And if my rudimentary math
is right,

00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,395
you're looking to give away
5% for $500,000.

Is that right?
That's right.
4.5.

00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,799

$400,000 this year.

beverage space to go into it.

00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,634
But I think for me,
the biggest thing

00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,937
that I bring in
when I decide

00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:49,073
whether to go into a brand
or not is the taste.

00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,743
The product has to punch me
and go, "Wow,"

00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:54,379
and you need
to work on that.

00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,546
I'm out.

00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,415
Congrats, guys.

00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:58,583
Appreciate it.
All right, guys,
thank you.

00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,084
Good luck, you guys.
Thank you.

At the end of the day,

00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:06,657
I'm doing this
with my two little brothers.

00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,626
It's ‐‐ It's love. It's trust.
It's hustle.

00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,295
It's competition,
and no coach, no Shark, no boss

00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,497
can tell us otherwise

00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,632
because we know
what we're set out to do,

00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,034
and we're
gonna go do it.

00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,635
I really wish
I could've got a deal.

00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,404
I was counting on you,
big shot.

00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,738
You know,
I would've.

00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,340
I'm ready to ‐‐ I mean, but ‐‐
and I'll put more in.

00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,642
But I need something
that when I throw it down,

00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,277
I'm like, "Wow."
