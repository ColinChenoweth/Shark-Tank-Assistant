So how big
is your online presence?

00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,375
Wholesale, 2 retailers
is about 80% of my business.

00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,377
The online is only 20%.

called Sand Cloud.

I've cooperated
with sometimes.

00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,250
...and they ran into
cash‐flow problems, right?
Yep.

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,985
So they couldn't
build inventory,

00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,386
they couldn't do wholesale
like you,

00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,121

Correct.

and they're killing it.

Okay.

that much?

more pictures?"

00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,778
So I jumped on a plane,
I flew to southeast Asia,

00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,413

random people at the beach

00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,814
and I said, "Hello."
Okay,
hold on.

00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:55,982

00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,585
Cheapest, closest place
is southeast Asia?

00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,953
No, cheap ‐‐
