The pet industry is huge,

yet it's little dogs

And if you've ever handled
a soiled pad,

We may love our little friends,

we created Brilliant Pad.

Each roll is equivalent

So you can leave this alone
for days, even weeks at a time.

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,392
Then when the roll is used up,
simply remove and replace.
